[Y]: Exceptions should be just that.. exceptions.  Best practice when using exceptions is to use them to cover the situation in which something contrary to what you would expect to happen happens.  The classic example is the FileNotFoundException which gets thrown when a file simply isn't there.  If you're testing the existence of the file, then you use File.exists() since you're simply prodding with a 10 foot stick to see if you hit something. You could technically accomplish the same results by surrounding it in a try catch and using the file as if it existed, but A) exceptions are generally costly resource-wise and B) programmers are going to assume you meant the file to exist if it was in a try catch, which adds to the overall confusion of a program. There are many situations in which I'll write a method which fetches some value from a database.  A thousand things could go wrong, and seeing how I only need one small piece of information, it's inconvenient to surround the call with a try catch list that contains 5 various exceptions.  So, I'll catch exceptions in the fetch method.  If something goes wrong, I take whatever appropriate action to close the database connection or whatnot in the finally clause and return null.  This is good practice not only because it simplifies your code but also because ""null"" sends the same message you could have gotten from an exception.. that something didn't go as planned.  Manage exception specifics in the fetch method, but manage what to do when things don't go as planned in the receiving end by checking to see if the result was null. For example:
Answer: ",,,"

The code and text are related in that they both discuss best practices for using exceptions in programming. The text describes how exceptions should be used to cover unexpected situations, and the code provides an example of how this can be done in practice. In the code, the getUserCount() method is written to catch various exceptions that could occur while trying to fetch data from a database. If any of these exceptions occur, the method will take appropriate action to close the database connection or whatnot and return null. This is useful because it allows the receiving method (doStuff()) to simply check if the result is null, rather than having to catch all of the various exceptions that could occur.",,,,,text-davinci-002,256,0.7,1,0,0,1

[Y]: Exceptions should be just that.. exceptions.  Best practice when using exceptions is to use them to cover the situation in which something contrary to what you would expect to happen happens.  The classic example is the FileNotFoundException which gets thrown when a file simply isn't there.  If you're testing the existence of the file, then you use File.exists() since you're simply prodding with a 10 foot stick to see if you hit something. You could technically accomplish the same results by surrounding it in a try catch and using the file as if it existed, but A) exceptions are generally costly resource-wise and B) programmers are going to assume you meant the file to exist if it was in a try catch, which adds to the overall confusion of a program.

[Y]:  The following is more of a statement than a question - it describes something that may be a pattern. The question is: is this a known pattern? Or, if it's not, should it be? I've had a situation where I had to iterate over two dissimilar multi-layer data structures and copy information from one to the other. Depending on particular use case, I had around eight different kinds of layers, combined in about eight different combinations: and so on After a few unsuccessful attempts to factor out the repetition of per-layer iteration code, I realized that the key difficulty in this refactoring was the fact that the bottom level needed access to data gathered at higher levels. To explicitly accommodate this requirement, I introduced  class with a number of  and   methods for accumulating the necessary information. In the end, I had the following class structure: It so happens that dataStructure1 is a uniform data structure, similar to XML DOM in that respect, while dataStructure2 is a legacy data structure made of various s and arrays. This allows me to pass dataStructure1 outside of the context for convenience. In general, either side of the iteration or both sides may be passed via context, as convenient. The key situation points are: complicated code that needs to be invoked in ""layers"", with multiple combinations of layer types possible at the bottom layer, the information from top layers needs to be visible. The key implementation points are: use of context class to access the data from all levels of iteration complicated iteration code encapsulated in implementation of pure virtual function two interfaces - one aware of underlying iterator, one not aware of it. use of  to simplify the usage syntax.

[Y]:  The following is more of a statement than a question - it describes something that may be a pattern. The question is: is this a known pattern? Or, if it's not, should it be? I've had a situation where I had to iterate over two dissimilar multi-layer data structures and copy information from one to the other. Depending on particular use case, I had around eight different kinds of layers, combined in about eight different combinations: and so on After a few unsuccessful attempts to factor out the repetition of per-layer iteration code, I realized that the key difficulty in this refactoring was the fact that the bottom level needed access to data gathered at higher levels. To explicitly accommodate this requirement, I introduced  class with a number of  and   methods for accumulating the necessary information. In the end, I had the following class structure: It so happens that dataStructure1 is a uniform data structure, similar to XML DOM in that respect, while dataStructure2 is a legacy data structure made of various s and arrays. This allows me to pass dataStructure1 outside of the context for convenience. In general, either side of the iteration or both sides may be passed via context, as convenient. The key situation points are: complicated code that needs to be invoked in ""layers"", with multiple combinations of layer types possible at the bottom layer, the information from top layers needs to be visible.

[Y]: Django coming years Spring MVC forms implementation strikes slightly crazy. you're not familiar,  starts form model class defines your fields. Spring similarly starts with form-backing object. But where Spring provides binding form elements backing object within your JSP, Django has form widgets tied directly model.  default widgets where you can add style attributes fields to apply CSS or define completely custom widgets classes.  goes  python code. That seems nuts to me. First, you are putting information about your view directly in your model and secondly you are binding your model specific view. Am I missing something?
